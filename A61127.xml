            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, have a favourable conſtruction of my ſo bold attempt, of ſo great a worke, upon ſuch weake abilitie, which may poſſibly ſeeme to ſavour as deeply of pride to ſome, as <hi>Davids</hi> undertaking the challenge of <hi>Goliah</hi> did to his brother <hi>Eliab, 1 Sam 17.28.</hi> But I am contented to walke naked before the world, and to under goe the cenſure of men, to performe any ſervice to God, or his people.</p>
            <p>The occaſion that preſſed me on chiefly to this worke, was by reaſon of ſome godly perſons, whoſe conſciences were ſcrupled about the baptizing of children before they came to know what they doe in the ſame; and others coming to heare of it, did much inſult upon them, in a reproachfull manner, with much reviling and deſpiſing of them; as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by a Letter received from them; and did as it were make a challenge upon them, with certaine Reaſons and Arguments, gathered up against them. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which occaſion the ſaid Reaſons and Arguments were ſent to me from beyond the Seas to be anſwered, and preſſed me with Letter after Letter to the ſame, which at length I intended to doe, onely in a private way, untill ſome here at home had publiſhed their evill affections in a reproachfull manner; caſting ſuch unſeemly aſperſions upon the truth of God, and godly perſons for the truths ſake, to make the ſame hatefull in the eyes of all men, in what them lieth. And others alſo in reſemblance of the truth, going on in ſuch a confuſed way, both in reſpect of corrupt doctrine, and as bad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; by reaſon of which diſorder, the bleſſed name of God, and his holy truth are expoſed unto much ſuffiring. And thus the glory of God, and the honour of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, lying as it were at the ſtake; and his people grieving and ſuffering together with the ſame. I thought in ſuch a caſe that I was bound in conſcience to come forth to the helpe of the Lord againſt the mightie; and to free my ſelfe from the ſinne of withholding the truth in unrighteouſneſſe; and according to that abilitie Christ bath given, to ſpeake a word in the defence of his bleſſed truth, against thoſe ungodly aſperſions cast upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>And thus having ſhewed my courteous Reader, the grounds forcing me to attempt ſo great a worke with ſo weake mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, I truſt he will ſparingly conſider, rather then raſhly cenſure, as the manner of too many is. And to judge as he would be judged, remembering there is a righteous Judge, before whom we muſt all appeare, and give account every one for himſelfe, as <hi>Rom. 14.10.12. 2 Cor. 5.10.</hi> The ſubject controverted in the following Treatiſe, one part of it is about Infants Baptiſme. And wheras I oppoſe the ſame as an unwritten tradition, yet I would not be underſtood that I oppoſe Infants, in reſpect of either their perſons, or age, or ſalvation it ſelfe, between God and them inviſibly, but honour them with all naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, deſiring their ſafety and well-being here, and glory here after; but what their eſtate is in reſpect of grace, that I doe not know, but as the ſame appeares by ſome effect of faith; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till which time, as I condemne none, no more dare I juſtifie all, but leave them all unto the good pleaſure of God, that onely knows who are his. And this I beleeve, that God of his meere grace, before the world was, did elect and chooſe a number in Chriſt to ſalvation. All which ſhall unavoydably come to glory, as <hi>Epheſ. 1. Rom. 8.30.</hi> But who theſe be, that I doe not know, untill God reveales the ſame by ſome effect of his grace appearing in them. And all that I intend by oppoſing Infants Baptiſme, is but onely to forbeare a while and waite upon God in the uſe of meanes, untill faith appeares to meet with God in his holy Ordinance, without which the ſame is voyd and of no effect; but prophaned, God provoked, and the party indangered. <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having a wedding garment, take him, &amp;c. Mat. 22.12, 13.</hi> And alſo that Baptiſme administred in an Antichriſtian Church, and by the ſame power, is no ordinance of God; ſo that all ſuch ſo baptized, are to ſubmit to the Lords ordinance of Baptiſme, whenſoever God calls them to beleeve and receive the Goſpel. And
<pb facs="tcp:40204:3"/>yet not holding any rebaptizing; for he that is once baptized with the Lords true Baptiſme, he needs no more. Nor yet a new way of baptizing, as ſome to pleaſe themſelves ſo call it; but onely that good old way, which <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles walked in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; and left the ſame as a Rule under command in the holy Scriptures, for ſuch as will be followers of them to walke by.</p>
            <p>And as it is recorded by the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures of God; even ſo it is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the most and beſt learned in the Land, ſo farre as I have ſeene, or can come by any of their writings. As in all the common Dictionaries, which with one joynt conſent affirme, that the word <hi>Baptiſme</hi> or <hi>Bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed it is a new found truth, in oppoſition to an old growne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and ſo it is a new thing to ſuch, as the Apoſtles Doctrine was to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Act. <hi>17.19.</hi> But this being no part of the following Diſcourſe, I ſhall leave it, and turne ſuch ſo mocking over to conſider of theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa. 28.22. Pro. 17.5. Iſa. 57.4. Act. 17.32. Heb. 11.36. Jude 18.</hi> &amp; <hi>Gen. 21.9. with Gal. 4.29.</hi> and I doubt not but the wiſe hearted Reader will thy and examine things of ſo high a nature by the Word of God, and not to build upon darke unſound conſequences, and falſe inferences, and lay by the plaine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Scripture, that muſt decide all doubts and controverſies in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>For ſure I am, there is neither command, nor example in all the New Teſtament, for any ſuch practiſe, as I know, and whatſoever is done in the worſhip of God, or obedience to Chriſt, without his command, or apparant example approved of by Christ, is of man, as a voluntary will worſhip,<note place="margin">Col. 2 20, 21, 22. Mark. 7.7, 8.</note> after the commandements and doctrines of men; the which Chriſt teſtifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt as a vaine thing. This way the Gentiles are more forward in, then ever the Jewes were; and more bitter againſt ſuch that doe oppoſe their traditions, then ever they were.</p>
            <p>And therefore I beſeech thee, Good Reader, beware of oppoſing the Goſpell, and Chriſts holy order in the ſame.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> For which thing God fell out with his ancient people the Jewes, and threatens to make the Gentiles drinke of the ſame cup, if they oppoſe the power and authoritie of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, as they did: and doe not the Gentiles this? Yea, and much more then ever the Jewes did.</p>
            <p>The Gentiles are ſet forth in Scripture to be the greateſt enemies that Christ and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell hath in the world;<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. Ezek. 38.

Of them is the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, out of which come the Locuſts, with a King over them: and of them is the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Dragon that ſtands againſt the Church, to ſuppreſſe and devour Chriſts holy order, and Government, and her ſubjection to the ſame. Of the Gentiles riſes that beaſtly State, with which the Kings of the earth joyne their powers, againſt Chriſts Kingly power and Subjects, and they tread underfoote the holy Citie. Not the earthly Citie <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as ſome weakly affirme, but the holy &amp; heavenly order of the Goſpell, and the true Subjects thereof. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Crucifie Chriſt in his myſticall body, which is more then to ſlay him in his humane body.</p>
            <p>There is a time ſet for the long ſuffering of God towards the Gentiles: Which time being once expired, God will have as ſtrict account of the Gentiles, as ever he tooke of the Jewes. Which day ſhall be as blacke and darke over the Gentiles, as ever it hath been to the Jewes. And more in that their ſinne hath been greater againſt grace, Chriſt, and his members, by many degrees then ever the Jewes were. And therefore woe woe unto the Gentiles, becauſe the day of their account draws neere. Therefore good Chriſtian Reader, be well adviſed, and doe not take part with any that ſhall oppoſe Chriſt in his ſweet and comely order among his Saints, and kingly Government over his Subjects. Wee ſee by apparant example, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thing it is to oppoſe Kings; but Chriſt is the King of Kings; therefore <hi>kiſſe the Sonne, leaſt he be angry,</hi> Pſal. <hi>2.12.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR a more orderly proceeding in the following Diſcourſe, I ſhall firſt lay downe the Arguments and Objections, and then give Anſwer to the ſame. And for ſome things in the beginning, I ſhall paſſe over briefely, they not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the point in hand. As the Scriptures being a perfect rule of all things, both for faith and order; this I confeſſe is a truth. And for the juſt and true conſequence of Scripture, I doe not deny; and the covenant of life lying between God and Chriſt for all his Elect, I doe not oppoſe: and that the outward profeſſion of the ſaid Covenant, hath differed under ſeverall Periods, I ſhall not deny: and of the Scriptures ſpeaking of the diſanulling and aboliſhing the old Covenant and making a new, is to be underſtood of the Period from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, and not of that from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi> This alſo in part I confeſſe, but not the whole; becauſe that the aboliſhing of the old Covenant or Teſtament, reached unto all that outward for me of worſhip, under any type or ſhadow, by which the people profeſſed their faith and obedience to God.</p>
            <p>So that the aboliſhing of types and ſhadows, muſt reach ſo farre as any types and ſhadows were, and that was unto Circumciſion it ſelfe: unto <hi>Abrahams</hi> Period; and beyond; even to all thoſe ſacrifices in any part of the old Teſtament, wherein God teſtified his pleaſure unto his people in any darke and typicall way, or they their faith and obedience to him by the ſame.</p>
            <p>So that the oppoſition the Scripture holds forth between Covenant &amp; Covenant, is between Teſtament and Teſtament, with reference to the order and forme of profeſſion thereof. But I leave this as little concerning the matter in hand, and come to that which follows. And the firſt to any purpoſe is layd downe thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That children are capable of the Spirit of God, and of the grace of the Covenant,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">

               </label> 
               <hi>and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever men of yeares are capable of, though not wrought in the ſame way, and by the ſame
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40204:4"/>meanes, yet the ſame things, and by the ſame Spirit, ſo farre as is neceſſary to union with Chriſt, and juſtification to life thereby: elſe children were not elected, or raiſed up againe in their bodies, and be ſaved; nor yet the judgement we can have of men of yeares be infallible, but we may be miſtaken, as in the caſe of</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>and others in the like nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> let it be in the firſt place conſidered, what may be here meant <hi>by children,</hi> becauſe the Scriptures ſpeake of children in a ſeverall reſpect.</p>
            <p>If ſuch children as the Scriptures call ſo, through weakneſſe in the faith, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 18.6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.13.</p>
            <p>Now if ſuch children as theſe, then I confeſſe, that ſuch are capable of the Spirit of God, and ſo of the reſt, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>by children</hi> be meant of <hi>infants,</hi> then we are to conſider what is meant <hi>by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſſe of the Spirit, the grace of the Covenant,</hi> and the reſt. If capable of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo as oppoſed to the power of the Spirit to worke upon them, ſo is a ſtone as well as a man, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p>But if capable to comply with the Spirit, in hearing, receiving, and beleeving the Spirits teſtimony; and ſo of Regeneration, faith, and repentance, &amp;c. This I ſhall deny, untill ſome proofe be produced from the Word of God for the ſame.</p>
            <p>And to affirme this to be Gods way to brings perſons to the faith, by working ſo upon them by his Spirit in their infancy, argues ſome ignorance of the true nature and worke of grace, as the Goſpell holds it forth.</p>
            <p>And to be capable of the grace of the Covenant, which muſt be underſtood of the promiſe containing the bleſſings and priviledges thereof, in the holy diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſame.</p>
            <p>We ſhall finde in the Scriptures of God, all the ſweet promiſes of Grace under the New Teſtament, holding forth their bleſſings, and bleſſed priviledges onely to ſuch as beleeve. And that to the Elect themſelves, as they are conſidered in Chriſt, and appeare ſo by ſome effect of grace, declaring their faith, and they to be ſuch as God approves of in his Sonne, and ſo to have viſible right to thoſe priviledges they are viſibly juſtified by, and poſſeſſed in, as ſuch that have a viſible right unto the ſame. Which can come to us Gentiles no other way then by Chriſt, and faith in his Name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if any ſhall object from the testimony of</hi> John the Baptiſt,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
               </label> 
               <hi>that he is ſaid to be filled with the holy Ghoſt from his Mothers wombe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.15.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. and hence conclude, that Infants may have faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer in a word; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> firſt, what Infants may have is one thing, and what Infants can from this Scripture be proved to have is another. For if any thing from this Text can be proved for Infants, it will be, that they are filled with the holy Ghoſt from the Mothers wombe, as <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to be, which is another thing then to beleeve; as <hi>Act.</hi> 6 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 31.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All ſuch ſo teſtified of by God, as he did of <hi>John,</hi> I ſhall acknowledge as much as is here meant to be in him, to be alſo in them ſo teſtified of by the holy Ghoſt. But to affirme, becauſe God ſo teſtified of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt in the wombe, therefore the ſame holds true upon all other Infants likewiſe. This is indeed weaker then infancy ſo to affirme,<note place="margin">Job. 31.18.</note> and groſſer then ignorance for any to beleeve. <hi>Job</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>Guide to the diſtreſſed from his Mothers wombe.</hi> Shall it be concluded thence, that he was a Guide to ſuch when he was an Infant: or if he were ſo, muſt it needs follow, that all Infants are capable Guides, becauſe it is ſaid ſo of him.</p>
            <p>And laſtly; I am not againſt any that have faith, but abſolutely for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40204:4"/>whether Infants or others; ſo that their faith appeares by ſuch effects as the Word of God approves of. Otherwiſe what have I or any man to doe, to meddle with the ſecret and unrevealed things of God, either to juſtifie or condemne.</p>
            <p>And whereas in the former Propoſition, there ſeemes a reſtraint made of the worke of grace in an Infant over there is in other perſons, by ſaying, <hi>onely ſo farre as is neceſſary to union with Chriſt, and juſtification to life thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for anſwer to this, we ſhall firſt conſider what in this ſenſe is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Chriſt: and ſecondly, what by union with Chriſt, ſo as to be juſtified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. By Chriſt here, I underſtand him ſo, as the Goſpel holds him forth in the work of mans Redemption, in reference to his death &amp; reſurrection; and the onely righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that commends ſuch to God as beleeve in the ſame. And ſo Chriſt thus conſidered, is the onely ſubject of life to every ſoule that ſhall be united unto him by faith. To which union with Chriſt, theſe three things muſt be minded, as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods revealing &amp; tendering of Chriſt, as the alſufficient &amp; onely way to life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A heart fitly diſpoſed by faith to apprehend and receive Chriſt ſo tendered.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, The Spirit of grace uniting and knitting of the heart and Chriſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And this I underſtand to be that effectuall and ſubſtantiall union with Chriſt, to juſtification of life, which the Word of God approves of; that moſt decide all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in matters of Religion. For juſtification to life, ever preſuppoſeth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Chriſt, as the ſubject of life, and a true application of the ſame by faith, as aforeſaid. The Goſpel holds forth no other juſtification to ſalvation, but what is or faith; and faith ever preſuppoſes the parties knowledge of the thing beleeved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
            <p>Now let this be well examined by the rule of truth, &amp; then let the Reader judge, how capable Infants are of union with Chriſt, and juſtification to life thereby. Now for to darken and obſcure this truth, there are theſe evill conſequences, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities brought in, as to follow upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, If Infants ſhould not be capable of thoſe graces aforeſaid, then they were not elected,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
               </label>
               <hi>Secondly, Then their bodies ſhould not be raiſed againe to life. And laſtly, We have not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible judgement, but may be miſtaken, as in the caſe of</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this in a word: and firſt I would know of ſuch,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> whether Infants with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their non-age, were the ſubjects of Gods Election. Secondly, If Infants ſo conſidered, are capable ſubjects of glory. And if not, as I ſuppoſe none will affirme, then why any more in Grace then in Glory. And for any to appoint God a way how to ſave Infants, or to draw out to themſelves a way how the holy Spirit of Grace muſt ſanctifie them to ſalvation, above what is written, I thinke it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too much boldneſſe. God will have his creature to keepe onely to his Word, as the Rule by which man muſt judge all things; and the Word of God ſhews that he hath elected perſons to the meanes as well as to the end, being the way unto the ſame. And that was the Adoption of Sonnes, and to be called and juſtified by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. And therefore the ground of Gods calling us, and our beleeving is attributed unto out Election, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. And to the glory of God, as the cauſe of all, by the diſpenſation of his grace upon his choſen in Chriſt, and their free obedience unto him againe, as <hi>Rom,</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6.12.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40204:5"/>
            <p>Theſe things God hath revealed in his Word; and further, I dare not goe, but leaving the ſecret things to God, who gives not account of all his wayes.</p>
            <p>And for the raiſing of Infants bodies, doth none riſe but ſuch as are in viſible uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt; as for inviſible things we meddle not with. It is the power of God that raiſeth the dead, and not union with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 4.16. And when any of Gods Elect can by the Scriptures be ſhewed to die in their infancy, then it will be granted that their bodies are raiſed to life eternall, onely as they are Infants. Nor that I hold all that dye in their infancy to be damned, but being a ſecret thing, I leave the ſame to God. And though that we have not infallible knowledge to judge aright of the hearts of men, which thing is proper to God alone: ſhall we not judge at all therefore? we are to goe on as neere as we can by the Rule of Gods Word; and in ſo doing, we diſcharge our dutie, which binds us to judge of the tree by his fruit. And though we are not infallible Judges, but may be miſtaken yet this will not follow, that we ſhould juſtifie a tree upon which no fruit at all appeares, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe on by the rule of judgement; and if we doe miſſe, to be humbled for our weakneſſe rather then leave all undone, becauſe we are not ſure to doe it infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But I would not be underſtood to oppoſe Infants ſo, as to exclude them from ſalvation; no, I am ſo farre from this, that I doe not ſo much as impoſe any ſuch worke of grace upon them, as eſſentiall to life, in this or that way, as many doe, but leave all in reſpect of them as a ſecret thing to the wiſdome and grace of God in Chriſt; by whom the ſinne of all the Elect are for ever done away at once.</p>
            <p>And for faith, that I preſſe for in all that challenge right to any priviledge of grace, is onely to have ſome warrantable ground to judge by, and ſo to know who God doth approve of; as thoſe unto whom ſuch priviledges belong. Seeing he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that <hi>all by nature are children of wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2. And I cannot beleeve that any are naturally borne in grace, and ſo beleevers from the wombe, though the oppoſite doctrine teacheth and affirmes the ſame. And ſo I come to another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, laid downe thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Baptiſme is not the firſt gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </label> 
               <hi>but the ſecond; neither doth it conferre grace, but is given to confirme the former, which therefore muſt be preſuppoſed, or elſe not to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. And it is the ſeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r elſe</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>and thoſe falſe brethren,</hi> Gal 2. <hi>being not baptized, and if they had repented, muſt have been baptized a new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſay much to this particular,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> becauſe our chiefeſt worke lies yet behind; onely thus much let the Reader obſerve, that here Baptiſme is ſaid to be given of God, as an Ordinance, to confirme ſaith in the ſubject baptized, and ſo to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, or elſe not to be adminiſtred. Now of God give it to that end for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme faith, then he never intended the ſame to be adminiſtred upon any, but onely ſuch as have faith. And ſo much the next words affirme, which ſay, <hi>That it muſt be preſuppoſed, or elſe not adminiſtred.</hi> Now I ſuppoſe it is meant, that faith in ſuch is to be preſuppoſed from ſome ground or viſible effect of faith, in appearance at the leſt. For no man can properly preſuppoſe a thing, without ſome appearing ground from whence his ſuppoſition muſt ariſe, and ſpecially in waightie matters. But what ground any man can have to preſuppoſe of childe in the wombe, or one that is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne, to have faith, and ſo capable of a ſeale, as to be confirmed by Baptiſme,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40204:5"/>I cannot conceive, but rather thinke it to be great weakneſſe in ſuch that ſhall ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe or affirme. For it is a doctrine that confirmes the opinion of ſuch as hold faith to be naturall, and in a man from the wombe; and as ſome ſay, they have been be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ever ſince they were borne: And ſo it is here; for when an Infant is once baptized, it goes ever afterwards for a beleever, as well as any that are never ſo cleare in the faith, unleſſe he comes to commit ſuch ſinne as to be excommunicated, untill which time he was ever a beleever before. But I paſſe from this, to the next particular thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That as of old, more was required of</hi> Abraham <hi>and men of yeares when they were Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
               </label>
               <hi>then of</hi> Iſhmael <hi>and</hi> Iſaac, <hi>or of other Infants, continually circumciſed afterwards; ſo now in the adminsſtring of Baptiſme, more is required of men of yeares, then is of Infants: of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>God required faith in the bleſſed ſeed; but not the ſame of</hi> Iſaac: <hi>Of men of yeares faith is to be required, and must be that a man may be baptized, but not the ſame of Infants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of this particular lies thus; That more is required of men of yeares,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> for their receiving of Baptiſme, then is of Infants; and all the proofe is from the example of <hi>Abraham, Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and others in like manner after them in the order of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. I ſhall give a briefe anſwer to this by an Argument drawne from the ſame, thus; Upon the ſame condition, that <hi>Abraham, Iſhmael,</hi> and all the reſt of his houſhold received Circumeiſion, ſo are all now to receive Baptiſme. But <hi>Abraham, Iſhmael,</hi> and all the reſt of his houſhold were circumciſed upon one and the ſame condition, without requiring any thing more of one then of another; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.23.25, 26, 27. Therefore all are to be baptized upon one and the ſame condition, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any thing more in one then in another, which is faith &amp; repentance in all alike, <hi>Mar.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 13, 37. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>faith in the bleſſed ſeed was required in</hi> Abraham, <hi>but not in</hi> Iſaac, <hi>who was to be circumciſed at eight dayes old;</hi> It is more then I finde the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale, that ſuch a faith was required of <hi>Abraham</hi> at the time of his circumciſion, or elſe he muſt not have been circumciſed; Or that the ſame faith in the bleſſed ſeed Jeſus Chriſt, was ſo required of all his houſhold at the time of their circumciſion, is more then yet appeares to me. And as it is ſaid, that <hi>the ſame faith was not required of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,</hi> no more was it required of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> who was 13. yeares old when he was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.25. not of the <hi>Shechemites</hi> being men of yeares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. So that this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition falls in it ſelfe; and ſo I leave it, &amp; come to the reaſons &amp; Arguments themſelves.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argument lies thus; If the Covenant now under Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Argu.</note> be the ſame that was before Chriſt, with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſteritie in the fleſh; then as Infants were partakers of the Covenant then, and received the ſeale thereof Circumciſion: ſo are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants now partakers of the Covenant, and ought to receive the ſeale thereof Baptiſme. But the Covenant now under Chriſt, is the ſame that was before Chriſt with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſteritie in the fleſh: Therefore as Infants were then in the Covenant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſeale thereof; even ſo are Infants now in the Covenant, and ought to receive the ſeale thereof. Three things are to be cleared in this Argument.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſteritie in the fleſh before Chriſt, and that now under Chriſt, is the ſame. Secondly, As Infants were in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo are Infants now. Thirdly, as Infants were ſealed then, ſo they ought to be now. Now for the proving of theſe aforeſaid, there are 3. other grounds laid down as follow.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Goſpel is the doctrine of the Covenant, but this being one, was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8.17.18. <hi>Rom</hi> 4.11. and ſo to the end; and to the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. and ſo in <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. &amp;c. Therefore the Covenant is the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40204:6"/>
            <p>Secondly, If <hi>Abraham</hi> be the Father of the Jewes and Gentiles, and equally as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the righteouſneſſe of faith, and they his children equally as ſo beleeving, and no otherwiſe: then the Covenant is the ſame. But <hi>Abraham</hi> is the father of the Jewes and Gentiles, and equally as he beleeves, as aforeſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12.16, 17.23, 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3.9.26.29. Therefore the Covenant is the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The ſtanding of the Jewes in the Grace of God, was the ſame with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> as is cleare from Gods often expreſſing of himſelfe to be the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; and praying to God for to remember the Covenant he made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and acknowledging the accompliſhing of the ſame to them, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.73, 74. <hi>Luk</hi> 1.54, 55. and ours in the ſame with the Jewes, as is cleare from <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41.43. &amp; 22.1. Therefore the Covenant is the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thus lies the Argument,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> and the grounds to back it, and all to prove the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, to be the ſame now to the beleeving Gentiles and their ſeed; and Infants to be in this now, as they were in that then.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, I ſhall onely touch at the three laſt grounds, briefly in a word, as I come to the Covenant it ſelfe. The firſt is becauſe the Goſpel is the doctrine of the Covenant, and was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the Jewes, &amp;c. therefore the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the ſame. For the firſt, if the preaching of the Goſpel, being the doctrine of the Covenant, can prove the Covenant to be the ſame to them as to us, then all to whom the Goſpel was and is preached, are in the ſame Covenant. But I think it is the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all beleeving of that which the Goſpel holds forth in the doctrine of it, that proves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Covenant, and not the preaching of it, becauſe many may have the Goſpel preached among them, and yet not be in the Covenant. And for the ſecond, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is the equall father both of the Jewes and Gentiles, onely as he did beleeve, and they his children onely ſo beleeving as their father <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and not elſe. In reſpect of which, the covenant is the ſame to the one as it is to the other. This in a ſenſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe is a truth, that none are accounted children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but onely as they beleeve as their father <hi>Abraham</hi> did: and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this be true, as the ground affirmes it is, then let the Reader judge, how Infants can be ſaid to be the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo to have right to Baptiſme, as the ſcale to confirme their ſaith, and whether they doe beleeve as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. But that <hi>Abraham</hi> may be ſaid to be an equall father both of the Jewes and Gentiles, I thinke not ſo in all reſpects: the Jewes were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they deſcended from his loynes as well as from his faith. But for the Gentiles they are called the ſeed or children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> onely as they walke in the ſteppes of his faith, and not elſe; as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 6.</p>
            <p>And laſtly,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
               </label> 
               <hi>that the ſtanding of the Jewes in the grace of God, was the ſame with</hi> Abrahams, <hi>and ours the ſame with the</hi> Jewes; <hi>therefore the Covenant is the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This doctrine ſo generally laid downe without diſtinction or exception, holds forth a mans falling from grace,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> or out of Gods gracious Covenant of life eternall. A do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be teſtified againſt by all that truely feare the Lord. For <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtanding was true and firme in Gods gracious Covenant; and if the <hi>Jewes</hi> was the ſame without exception, then the <hi>Jewes</hi> that did oppoſe Chriſt, and were cut off for the ſame, fell out of this Covenant of grace. But I ſhall further cleare this in that which follows; and ſo I come to the Covenant it ſelfe, and to ſee how that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and this under Chriſt, will agree. In the handling of which, in the firſt place this muſt be well obſerved,<note place="margin">A double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eed in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
               </note> that there was in <hi>Abraham</hi> a double ſecd when God made his covenant with him and his ſeed, and confirmed the ſame by the ſeale of Circumciſion. There was in <hi>Abraham</hi> at that time a ſpirituall ſeed and a fleſhly ſeed. Between which ſeeds God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40204:6"/>ever diſtinguiſhed through all their Generations. And as there was a diſtinction thus made by God in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed before they were circumciſed, and yet admitted to the ſeale of the Covenant by Gods ſpeciall command. For <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were by God commanded to be circumciſed as well as any of the reſt of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>Gen</hi> 17.10.13. Even ſo there muſt be the ſame reſpect obſerved alſo in the Covenant, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Covenant comprehends divers things; and Circumciſion was a ſeale unto them all. Some of which were proper unto both the ſeeds, and ſome not; as may be gathered from the ſeverall branches of the Covenant expreſſed by God, <hi>Gen,</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>As firſt, for the multiplication of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2. this was proper as well to his fieſhly ſeed, as his ſpirituall; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 17.8. This was proper alſo to both the ſeeds of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And as it was onely a temporall inheritance, the ſame was conditionall, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. And ſo confirmed by circumciſion upon both the ſeeds of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9, 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20. And as it pointed at a ſpirituall inheritance, ſhadowed out under it. Now thus conſidered, it was abſolute, and confirmed onely upon the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſeed; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.19.21. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That from <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes ſhould come a ſeed, in whom all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16.19. &amp; 18.10.18. &amp; 21.2. This bleſſed branch of the Covenant was proper onely to the ſpirituall ſeed, conſidered either in the cauſe, or in the effect; as <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, 8.9, 16.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Abrahams</hi> fatherhood of the faithfull; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.4, 5. This was onely proper to faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, as they are found walking in the ſteppes of his faith; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6, 7, 9 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed after him in their generations; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. That was faithfully to performe all that he had promiſed, either to <hi>Abraham</hi> in particular, or his ſeed in generall; as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105 9.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72, 73, 74. In token of which God annexed Circumciſion, as a ſeale to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. Theſe are the ſeverall parts and branches of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, and Circumciſion in the fleſh as a ſeale to confirme every part to each ſeed, as was proper to the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if any ſhall ſay, the Scriptures deny many ſeeds,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">

               <hi>and approve onely of one ſeed in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, with whom the promiſe was made; as</hi> Gal. 3.16.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer and ſay, that this place well conſidered, will help forward the truth; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> for the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of the Covenant, ſo as comprehending Chriſt the ſubſtance of the ſame, and the Elect in him for eternall life. In which ſenſe the covenant of grace was not made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to all his ſeed without exception; for then all his ſeed muſt either be ſaved, or elſe ſuch as are not but periſh, muſt fall out of the ſaid covenant of Grace; for I ſuppoſe no man will ſay, that all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> without exception were ſaved. And if not, then there was ſome of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed comprehended in the Covenant in one ſenſe, and admitted to the ſeale thereof, whom God excepted againſt in another: ſome of which was <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſignifying in <hi>Abrahams</hi> generation, a fleſhly ſeed as well as a ſpirituall; between which ſeeds God ever held forth a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction through all their generations, from <hi>Abraham</hi> untill Chriſt, who put an end to the type and the fleſh, and all priviledges of that nature thereunto belonging;<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. So that now all is laid up in Chriſt, as Gods ſtore-houſe and treaſury, and in him only for ſuch as beleeve, and therefore now firſt in Chriſt by faith, and then to the Covenant and the priviledges thereof; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. And none by the Goſpel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of now to be the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but onely ſuch as walke in the ſteps of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40204:7"/>ſaith. For as none inviſible before God, are by him at all approved to have right to any priviledge of grace, but onely as he lookes upon them in his Sonne: No more are there any viſibly before men to be approved of, ſo as to have right to the ſame, but as they appeare to be in Chriſt by ſome effect of faith declaring the ſame. And ſo much the more, in that God excludes all from his holy Covenant, is to have right in the outward diſpenſation thereof, but onely ſuch as beleeve. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22.26.29.</p>
            <p>Let all this be well conſidered, and I doubt not but the difference between the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> before Chriſt, and this under Chriſt, will appeare very great, though in ſome reſpect for ſubſtance the ſame. Yet in the outward profeſſion of them, the difference is great, both in reſpect of perſons and things. Wherein our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent chiefly lyes: that covenant admitted of a fleſhly ſeed, but this only of a ſpirituall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. That in the fleſh, and this in the heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. The ſeale and ordinances of that Covenant, confirmed faith in things to come, but the ſeale and ordinances of this, confirme faith in things already done.</p>
            <p>That Covenant was nationall, and admitted all of the ſame to the ſeales thereof; but this perſonall, and admits of none but ſuch as beleeve. That Covenant begot children after the fleſh, as all <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall poſteritie. But this onely begets children after the Spirit, and onely approves of ſuch as are begotten and borne from above, in whoſe hearts God writes his Law, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5, 6. That covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſteritie before Chriſt, comprehended a civill State, and a worldly Government, with the like carnall Subjects for the ſervice of the ſame. But this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now under Chriſt, comprehends onely a ſpirituall State, and a heavenly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the like ſpirituall Subjects for the ſervice of this alſo. That covenant held forth Chriſt in the fleſh to a heart vailed; this holds him forth after the Spirit to a face open, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. In all underſtand, the viſible profeſſion of the Covenant, in the out ward diſpenſation of the priviledges thereof.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>being one and the ſame, as aforeſaid, That as Infants were in that covenant then, and circumciſed, ſo are Infants in this now, and to be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to which,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
               </label> I ſhall commit in the firſt place, to the Readers conſideration theſe particulars, for the further clearing of the aforeſaid truth. Firſt, What the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is. Secondly, What is that which admits into the ſaid Covenant. Thirdly, Who are the true approved Subjects of this Covenant. And laſtly, Whether all have not one and the ſame way of entrance into the ſaid Covenant: and to each of theſe a word.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Covenant it ſelfe, is a Covenant of grace and ſalvation, by which God of his grace takes a perſon or a people to himſelfe for his own above all others, and to be their God, and to man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſt upon them the riches of his grace and glory: and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of which is in effect but onely thus much; Gods calling of a man to an agreement with himſelfe in his Sonne, wherein he promiſes to be his God, and to give him life and happines, and all things in Chriſt, and that he ſhall beleeve and reſt upon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and truth, and ſo take him for his God, &amp;c. And thus I ſay, God and man come to an agreement in Chriſt, upon ſomething paſſing between them, wherein they both agree, and this is called a Coveannt; and I call it a covenant of grace, when the thing agreed upon is a ſubject of grace; as Gods giving of man life and peace, and all things in Jeſus Chriſt, and that he will be his God, upon whom he ſhall relie, and beleeve the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of all things in his due time; and that he ſhall heare and know his will by his Sonne, and obey him in the ſame; and mans free conſent to God againe, that he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40204:7"/>likes of all this well, and concludes with God that it ſhall be ſo. For a Covenant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth two perſons at leaſt, and alſo ſomething to agree, or covenant upon: thus did God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo he doth with every beleever; and chiefely when God takes any into a Church-fellowſhip. So that the covenant conſiſteth of theſe eſſentials. Firſt, the perſons diſpoſed to agree. Secondly, ſomething to agree upon. And laſtly, their mutuall conſent, which is the agreement it ſelfe. And ſo much for the Covenant, and what the ſame is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What it is that gives right to enter, or admits any into the ſaid Covenant,<note place="margin">What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note>and that is the promiſe of God in Chriſt, and faith in the ſame, that gives right of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and onely admits into Covenant with God; as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.8. The Covenant afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, hath theſe eſſentiall parts, and viſible branches. Firſt, Grace in the agent, God. Secondly, faith in the Subject, Man. Thirdly, a uniting or cloſing of theſe together, which is that mutuall conſent &amp; agreement by faith in the ſame grace, revealed by the Goſpel, which is the word of Reconciliation. So that it is the bleſſed word of life, and faith in the ſame that gives right, and admits into Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Who are the true approved Subjects of this Covenant, and they are onely ſuch as beleeve; for God approves of none in covenant with him by his Word out of Chriſt, nor of any in Chriſt without faith. Nay, God denies his approving of any in fellowſhip or communion with him, that doe not beleeve; as <hi>John</hi> 3.5, 6 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. Thus God approves of none as Subjects of his gracious covenant, but onely ſuch as he hath elected and choſen in Chriſt, and ſo appearing by ſome fruit and effects of the ſame; as theſe Scriptures, (with many other) witnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. So that ſuch as are the choſen and called of the Lord, are the onely approved Subjects by him in his ſaving and ever-bleſſed Covenant of life.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt is this; Whether that all perſons now under the Goſpel, have not one and the ſame way of entrance into the foreſaid Covenant?</p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, the holy Word of God muſt be Judge, and I finds the Goſpel of Chriſt to approve of none in the Lords holy Covenant of grace, but ſuch as beleeve; neither any approved of, as to be in the way of life, but ſuch as are in Chriſt by faith; and therefore no other way to come into the Covenant of grace and ſalvation (as the Scriptures reveale) but only by Jeſus Chriſt. For in him are all the promiſes confirmed, &amp; made over only unto ſuch as beleeve; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 4 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.</p>
            <p>The holy Covenant of life conſiſteth of theſe three eſſentialls for entrance thereinto.<note place="margin">The eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of the covenant.</note> Firſt, the word of God to reveale the ſame. Secondly, Chriſt to open the way, and to inright the partie therein. And laſtly, faith without which none can enter thereinto. So that as there is but onely one way of entrance into Covenant with God, that the Scripture reveals now under the Goſpel, &amp; that is by Jeſus Chriſt, and faith in his name. Then all muſt enter this way that can be approved in covenant with God; for none can come to the Father but by the Sonne, nor any to the Sonne but by faith; as <hi>John</hi> 14.6. with <hi>John</hi> 6.44.45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Let all this be well conſidered, and then ſee how Infants are diſcovered to be in this Covenant, &amp; what way of entrance hath God by his word appointed for them to come in, and denied the ſame unto others, except they be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally begotten &amp; born in the covenant, and ſo were never out of the ſame: which thing indeed the oppoſite doctrine affirmes; for if Infants be in the covenant of grace, and that by vertue of their being borne of beleeving parents who are in the ſame, then ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are borne in a ſaving eſtate of grace, and were never out of the ſame; which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine makes voyd many heavenly and divine truths that ſpeak to the contrary, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40204:8"/>lay all under ſin and wrath for the ſame; as conceived in ſin, borne children of wrath, and ſo under the curſe, untill Chriſt by his bloud and death redeemes them, and by his heavenly voice calls them, and by his holy Spirit of grace, begets them unto a lively hope, working faith in their hearts, to lay hold upon Chriſt, Gods arme of ſalvation that carries them up to glory; and therefore all are ſaid to be borne againe from above, of water and of the Spirit, before they can enter into the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>Now for ſuch as are begotten and borne in the covenant, being the ſeed of beleevers, as is affirmed, then ſuch were never out of the ſame; which doctrine diſables them of any of the former priviledges by Chriſt; for none can be under grace, wrath &amp; the curſe at one and the ſame time, in the outward diſpenſation of the ſame; the which all out diſcourſe intends; for inviſible things belong to God: and ſo I come to ſome other grounds, tending to prove Infants to be in the covenant now, as they were of old, and they are theſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This particular conſiſts of two parts,<label type="milestone">

               </label> and the firſt is to this effect; if Infants be not in the covenant now as they were at the firſt, then is the covenant of leſſe extent ſince Chriſts coming, then it was before; the anſwer is, that indeed it is of leſſe extent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the fleſh, by Chriſts coming, then it was before, becauſe that by him is taken away all fleſhly reſpects, either in regard of perſons or priviledges in matters of grace; which is a further inlarging of the covenant in a ſpirituall ſenſe; for the neerer the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant comes to perfection, the larger it is; and the perfection of the covenant in one ſenſe is this, to have nothing contained in it, but what is truely of it; and the contrary is a ſtraitning of the ſame, and a bondage unto the true Subjects thereof.</p>
            <p>Againe, It can not properly be ſaid, that the covenant in the full accompliſhment of the ſame in glory, will be more ſtraite &amp; of leſſe extent then now in grace; and yet there ſhall be none but onely ſuch as truely appeare to be of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond part of the Propoſition lies to this effect;</hi>

               </label> let the Reader conſider well, what was required to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe Infants into the covenant the, and ſee if there be the ſame for to intereſſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants into the covenant now. There was required then, 1.2 male onely of 8. dayes old. 2. of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and laſtly, a ſpeciall command from God for the ſame in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; for though that the covenant had been never ſo firme between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet if he had not had a command in ſpeciall to Circumciſe, I ſuppoſe he would not have done it: &amp; if the command had bin only to have preached the way of God to the people, and to circumciſe ſuch as beleeved, and imbraced the ſame truth preached unto them, and no other expreſſe word of command for an Infant of 8. dayes old, &amp; that the practiſe of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> had been the ſame, without any direct and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant example of their circumciſing Infants. I do beleeve that none of the <hi>Jews</hi> that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40204:8"/>feared God, would have been ſo bold as to have circumciſed their Infants, or if they had, let the indifferent reader judge, by the word of God, if it had not been a ſin of preſumption to goe above what was written: &amp; for their perſonall intereſſe into the covenant, this is required now, as was then, to be of the ſeed, or children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and viſibly ſo appearing now, they did then. And who theſe are, I appeale to the word of god for righteous judgement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8, 9.16.22.26.29. This I have ſhewed before, and ſhall more cleare hereafter; and ſo I come to another Propoſition thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham being the roote, and the Jewes and Gentiles the branches; When the Jewes Were broken off, as well Infants as men of yeares were ſo alſo: the like when the Jewes ſhall be planted in againe, as well In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as men of yeares ſhall be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To paſſe over the difficulties, and things that will not be granted about the Jews coming in, as this argument ſeems to import in the laying downe of it, I ſhall onely ſpeak a word to what is intended, of implied; and for the better underſtanding of all in a word, let the Reader well conſider, in what ſenſe the Goſpel holds forth <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the roote of Jewes and Gentiles. Secondly, how the Jewes and Gentiles may be ſaid to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> branches. Thirdly, the way of their breaking off. And laſtly, what way this will make for the Gentiles and their Infants to come in, and for the Jewes and their Infants coming in, I ſhall let that ſtand by untill the time comes, or for ſome Scripture to reveale how the ſame ſhall be.</p>
            <p>And firſt to ſee how the Goſpel holds forth <hi>Abraham</hi> for a root of Jews &amp; Gentiles, and that is onely in reſpect of his faith and faithfulneſſe, and ſo he is the paterne and father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that reſemble him in the ſame, otherwiſe <hi>Abraham</hi> is not the root of the Gentiles, for they deſcended not from his loynes as the Jewes did. So that the Jewes and Gentiles are <hi>Abrahams</hi> branches, onely as they ſpring out of the ſame root by ſaith, which declares them to be his true naturall branches, ſo farre as they onely appeare to be of the ſame faith as he was. This I have been upon ſomewhat before, and ſhall be more fully hereafter. But now for the Jews breaking off, this was onely for want of their activall beleeving the Goſpel; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and oppoſing the ſame, <hi>Act.</hi> 13 46. Even ſo were the Gentiles received in, onely upon their actuall beleeving and receiving the ſame. And as God rejected none of the ſeed of the Jewes that beleeved, for their parents unbeliefe; no more doth god admit of the Gentiles ſeed that doe not beleeve, for their parents beleeving; for as the word condemnes none, but with reſpect to actuall ſinne; no more doth the word juſtifie any, but with reſpect to actuall faith: and as every ones owne faith in Chriſt inrights to life, ſo every ones own faith in Chriſt inrights to the priviledges of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Jewes and the Gentiles being incorporated into one body in Chriſt; as</hi> Eph. 2.11. <hi>to</hi> 20. <hi>As the Jewes Infants were in the ſame body, even ſo muſt the Infants of the Gentiles be alſo.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, in a word, that the Church of the New Teſtament conſiſts both of Jews &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: this is a truth, and admits of all that beleeve, and rejects none; and for the Gentiles In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being in the ſame body as well as the Jews Infants. This I alſo beleeve, both alike; for the Church of the New Teſtament, though it couſiſts of Jews and Gentiles, yet ſhe never admitted of any Infants as members in her body, or to the priviledges thereof, but as they appeared to beleeve, and ſo capable, of the ſame.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, let the Reader conſider well, that for a man to take this unto <hi>Abraham, I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeed,</hi> for a ground of Circumciſion; this cannot be ſo, but onely the word of command that enjoyned the thing; for if God had but onely made his covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not a commanded him to circumciſe, it had been ſin for him to a circumciſed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40204:9"/>any; ſo that it was not the promiſe, but the command that was the ground of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and the Jewes circumciſing their Infants. And ſo the ſame ground muſt ſerve the Gentiles to baptize their Infants, which is not the covenant, but the like expreſſe command from Chriſt for the ſame; but as there is none, therefore the firſt; yet the ſecond is not true, and ſo Infants are not to be baptized. Againe, let it be minded, in what ſenſe God did covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his God, and the God of his ſeed. 2. How we are to conſider <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, with which God made his covenant. For the firſt, God ſets forth himſelfe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

And with reſpect to which faith and faithfulnes, God took in with <hi>Abraham,</hi> all his poſterity for a people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe under Circumciſion, and other Ordinances, by which God did diſtinguiſh them from all other Nations in the world. And to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed after him, that was faithfully to performe his promiſe, in making of him great, &amp; giving him a ſeed, in whom the Nations ſhould be bleſſed, with which ſeed he would eſtabliſh his covenant, for an everlaſting covenant; and ſo he would be a God to his ſeed after him, in doing for them all that he had promiſed, to multiply them, to give them that fruitfull Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo to bleſſe them with great proſperitie. <hi>And alſo I will be their God,</hi> that is, their God whom they ſhall beleeve and obey, upon whom they ſhall depend for the performance of all that I have promiſed unto them; by which faith and obedience they ſhall acknowledge me to be their God.</p>
            <p>Now theſe being the particular expreſſions of the covenant, and as they lie barely in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they art figurative ſpeeches, and ſo conſidered onely as they were temporall; for ſo was <hi>Canaan</hi> a temporall inheritance, and ſo were the other outward bleſſings, under which were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured our ſpirituall ſubſtances, onely to the like Subjects. And as they were outward or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſo conſidered they were both generall and conditionall; for as the people did then beleeve God, and obey him, ſo they did enjoy them, and not elſe; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. Unto which covenant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was added, as a token, to put the people alwayes in minde of the ſaid covenant; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. and a ſeale to confirme the covenant on both the ſides, God to be a God unto them as aforeſaid, and they for his own people above all others, and ſo to performe the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith and obedience, as <hi>Abraham</hi> their father did. And to walke as ſuch circumciſed in heart, unto which they were ingaged by that Ordinance; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25, 26, 27, 28 29. otherwiſe the covenant ſtood not in force for their outward proſper it is, that was the glory of that people in generall. In which reſpect onely, the covenant, the ſeale, and the inheritance, are all of a like extent; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.8.13. and ſo ended in Chriſt, in whom all ſtands firme onely to ſuch as beleeve; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. This covenant was accompliſhed by God upon the Jewes at three ſeverall times, as they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. Firſt, in bringing them from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan.</hi> Secondly, from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And laſtly, Chriſts coming in the fleſh, as the ſeed in whom all Nations ſhould be bleſſed. This bleſſed ſeed according to the covenant God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was ſent firſt to <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeed the Jews in generall; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.11. To bleſſe them, by calling them to repentance, and ſo to turne them from their ſins; as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 13 23.26 32, 33. Thus the King of heaven offered his Sonne firſt in marriage to the Jews; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. and being refuſed by them, he ſought him a wife among the Gentiles; as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. And ſo much for the promiſe or covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, which for the right underſtanding of it, muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a ſeverall reſpect, according to the ſeed but not ſo to the Gentiles and their ſeed, the Covenant lies not to them in a figurative way, not in any fleſhly or temporall reſpect, as it did to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed in the fleſh: but to the Gentiles in ſubſtance, onely as they are in Chriſt by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40204:9"/>faith, and ſo upright as <hi>Abraham</hi> was when God made covenant with him; and if otherwiſe, that the Gentiles, muſt be conſidered as the Jews, then they muſt have a fleſhly ſeed, under the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall reſpect as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, &amp; have onely one publike head, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was to bring them in, &amp; all ſtand in the ſame relation as children to a father, to that one head, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed did unto him, and come in the ſame way, both for covenant, and command, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed did: All which the Scriptures deny the Gentiles for coming in ſuch a way.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come now to the ſeed; and firſt to begin in the fountaine and head-ſpring of all, at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> and ſee the Goſpels diſcovery of heir ſeed, compared with the Law, by which it will appeare what the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is, that God approves of to be in the covenant with him, and ſo to have right to the ſeale there of. There was under the old Teſtament a generall ſtated peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in an outward forme of profeſſion; among whom God owned but a remnant to belong unto him in his gracious covenant of life; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27.

            <p>Now unto theſe two ſtated or bodyed people, there is in the Scriptures two typicall heads, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24, 25. Here <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> as the two Mothers, type out the two Teſtaments; even ſo their two ſons, <hi>IſhmAel</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> type out the ſubjects of the ſame, the one by the bond-woman born after the fleſh, but he of the free-woman was by promiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Now as <hi>Hagar</hi> the Mother, ſignified the old ſtate in generall, ſo <hi>IſhmAel</hi> her ſon, ſignified the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame ſtate, borne after the fleſh, as he was; for though that he was of the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> yet he was no childe of promiſe. Now for <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhe was the lawfull wife of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo a free-woman, with whom the Apoſtle compares the ſtate of the Church of the new Teſtament, the true ſpouſe and wife of Chriſt, who is free from all ſervitude and bondage, &amp; ſtands onely in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Chriſt her husband, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And <hi>Iſaac</hi> her ſon, ſignifying the true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bleſſed ſeed. Of this holy ſtocke according to the Spirit, and ſo as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was true heire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe; for the Goſpel approves of none as true heires of the bleſſing, &amp; ſo the right ſeed, and truely in the covenant, but onely ſuch as the promiſe produceth &amp; brings forth, as it did <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for <hi>Iſaac</hi> came not by an ordinary courſe of nature, but by vertue of the promiſe of God, and faith in the ſame, which raiſed nature above it ſelfe to bring him forth; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.10, 11, 12. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11, 12. By this the wiſdome of God in the Apoſtle holds forth as in a figure, who are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, approved of in the Goſpel, &amp; they are ſuch as are brought forth by a power above nature, which is by the promiſe of God, &amp; faith in the ſame, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was. And therefore ſuch are ſaid to be as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, children of the free-woman, the true ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> after the Spirit, &amp; ſo heires according to promiſe; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Rom</hi> 9 8.</p>
            <p>Now the promiſe in the letter, the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> an earthly poſſeſſion anſwerable to the heire naturall, and Circumciſion in the fleſh, as a ſeale to confirme the ſame upon condition of the like faith and obedience, and ſo to walke as ſuch circumciſed in heart. So God would be their God, to bleſſe, increaſe, and to bring them into their promiſed inheritance; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.

               </note> conſider of it thus; firſt, that no beleever now can ſo ſtand to his ſeed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> of old did unto his ſeed, except he aſſumes the place of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and alſo his fatherhood over all the faithfull. But if any beleever ſhould ſo farre preſume as to aſſume <hi>Abrahams,</hi> place, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood upon him, yet another cannot doe ſo. Except we make may <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and ſo all fathers, and no children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if it be ſaid, that every beleever in his owne familie is an Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſo, then he is the ſame unto his ſervants as well as to his children, for ſo was <hi>Abraham.</hi>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Then a beleever would have a greater priviledge then ever <hi>Abraham</hi> had; for the covenant was not founded upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſonall ſeed, for had it been ſo, then the priviledges thereof would have reached to all <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſonall ſeed, as well as to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> But this it did not, for <hi>Abraham</hi> begot many children of his own body beſides <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who ſhared not with him, neither in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or priviledges thereof; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.1. to 6. The like it is with the beleevers ſeed, to which the covenant lyes, not in any reſpect, as to a particular ſeed, but joyntly conſidered together as a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſo the Church of Chriſt, and their off-ſpring, ſeed, or children, as aforeſaid, conſidered, are the generation of the righteous, ſucceeding them in the faith, not in the fleſh.

               </note> it was not <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſonall being in the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor yet his faith that brought in his ſeed, or admitted the ſame to the ſeale thereof, but onely Gods ſpeciall commandement, for both <hi>Abraham</hi> and many others were in the covenant of grace long before Circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred; and the reaſon why ſuch were not ſealed with circumciſion before that time, was be cauſe that God no where had commanded the ſame. No more can a beleevers being in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now, bring in his ſeed, nor admit of the ſame to Baptiſme, without Gods ſpeciall command for the ſame now, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had then, otherwiſe they proudly aſſume a priviledge above their father <hi>Abraham.</hi> And though that beleevers are in ſome ſenſe under the ſame covenant now, as then, yet in no ſenſe under the ſame command, for then they muſt circumciſe, and not baptize, and that Males onely, and not females alſo. But as there is a new King, ſo there muſt be a new Law, and as a new covenant, ſo a new ſubject; a new Church muſt have a new ſtate, &amp; a new ordinance, a new commandement; ſo that as all things are become new, even ſo muſt all be of God, whoſe will is to be obeyed in whatſoever he commands, which is the only ground of all mans obedience; for no man can be ſaid to obey God in doing that which he hath not commanded: therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no command from the Lord for the Baptizing of Infants, as was for the circumciſing of Infants, though by <hi>Abraham</hi> they were circumciſed, yet by Chriſt, they ſhall not be baptized.

That it was the ſame baptiſme with ours ſpiritually is evident; the other Ordinances there mentioned were the ſame ſpiritually with ours;</hi> for they eate the ſame ſpirituall meate, and dranke the ſame ſpirituall drinke with us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Therefore they were baptized with the ſame ſpirituall baptiſme: Otherwiſe the Apoſtles argument were not of force againſt the</hi> Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <hi>if they were not the ſame Sacraments with ours, nor the concluſion contained that the</hi> Corinthians <hi>ſhould be pun ſhed with the like puniſhment, if they committed the like ſins; therfore the argument is firme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, I ſhall endeavour to be briefe, therefore let the Reader conſider well theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Firſt, here God took unto himſelfe the whole body of theſe people the Jewes, who were his own people before by covenant; for they were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the family of <hi>Jacob</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40204:10"/>that came into <hi>Aegypt</hi> to ſojourne there; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. Now let the like be made to appeare that God ever took unto himſelfe the whole body of the Gentiles, as he did the Jewes, and then it will be ſomewhat the ſame with the Gentils and their ſeed, as it was with the Jews and their ſeed. But if the one cannot be proved, then the other will not be granted: and ſo this argument falls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Secondly, here was no ordinance of the new Teſtament, much leſſe Baptiſme adminiſtred upon any of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at their departing out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but onely Gods great power &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, declared by leading of his people through the maine Sea, in and by the which God did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, and ſo delivered them up as it were to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to his Government and direction, as a people preſerved in death. As in and by Baptiſme the partie being by the grace and power of God preſerved, he is delivered up to Chriſt, to his Government and direction, as one riſen from death, with a new life to God; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Baptiſme in the Cloud and in the Sea, was onely in the type or ſhadow, and ſo in the Letter of the old Teſtament, oppoſed to the Miniſtration of the Spirit in the new Teſtament; as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and is ours ſo far as the type may agree with the truth and no further. So that in the type and figure it was theirs, but in the truth and ſubſtance it is ours; Therefore that Baptiſme which they had in the old Teſtament under a vaile, was not the ſame Baptiſme that we have in the new Teſtament with the face open, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. And though that Infants were baptized with their Baptiſme, yet Infants are not to be baptized with our Baptiſme; <hi>for we have an Altar where of they have no right to eat which ſerve the Tabernacle.</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note>Thirdly, that Infants were then baptized with the ſame Baptiſme ſpiritually that ours is; this I ſomewhat queſtion, becauſe to be ſpiritually baptized, is to have the internall and ſpirituall part of Baptiſme, and ſo the ſubſtance as well as the externall part, and then all ſuch ſo baptized as I thinke muſt be ſaved. But many of them that were baptized in the Cloud &amp; Sea, were overthrowne in the Wilderneſſe, as a teſtimony of Gods wrath againſt them; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. Therefore ſuch though they had the outward externall part, and ſo the ſhadow, yet not the internall and ſpirituall part, the ſubſtance; and ſo not the ſame Baptiſme with ours ſpiritually as affirmed. Againe, they were not ſpirituall ſimply in themſelves conſidered, for then the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and the cattell that went out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> with them, ſhould have ſo partaken of them; for the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> eate of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and the cattell dranke of the water, and all paſſed through the Sea. Therefore they were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall only as they ſerved to ſome ſpirituall end or uſe appointed by God, and that was as they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified &amp; held out ſome ſpirituall thing. So that ſuch are ſaid to eate of the ſame ſpirituall meate, and to drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke, which are capable ſo for to eate and to drinke of them, as they are ſpirituall things. And ſo the bleſſed Apoſtle applyes the ſame unto Fathers, as men of yeares and ſo capable, and not unto Infants, neither doe I finde Infants puniſhed among the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, nor yet threatned by the Apoſtle among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the Apoſtles ſenſe. And this way carries the Apoſtles Argument in force againſt the like ſinners among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> or any other people; for the ſcope of the Apoſtles Argument is to informe the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſo all others as well, that no outward priviledge whatſoever, ſhall ſecure any people from puniſhment that goe on in ſinne. And to make this appeare to be true, he preſents them with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Gods dealing with his own people of old, even our fathers, who had as great outward priviledges as any the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had, and yet for all this, upon their going on in ſinne, God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them accordingly.</p>
            <p>But what for all this; Suppoſe all be granted, that the whole body of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> together with their Infants, paſſed through the Sea, and were all baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea. What can this make for the proving of the Gentils baptizing of their Infants now under the New Teſtament? If this proves any thing for Infants Baptiſme, it muſt be upon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, unto the ſame end, and by the like command, as all the former was; for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a ſpeciall command from God for all that they did; to depart with their Infants out or <hi>Aegypt</hi> by name, and to paſſe through the Sea, and to follow the Cloud, and to doe whatſoever was done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40204:11"/>by them, or their Infants. Now if there be not the like occaſion, end, and command from the Lord, to the Gentils, for them to baptize their Infants, as here was for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> then the Argument is infirme, and of no worth; but there is no ſuch command from God for the ſame: Therefore, though that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Infants were baptized then, yet the Gentiles Infants muſt not be baptized now. And ſo I come to the third Argument, laid downe thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is one and the ſame conſideration of the firſt fruits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>and the lumpe, the roote and the branches; but the firſt fruits and roote beleeving Parents are holy, and muſt be baptized; therefore Infants the lumpe and branches are holy, and muſt be baptized alſo. The firſt part is cleare from the Law, of ſanctifying the reſt of the fruits, by offering the firſt fruits, there being nothing more required. The ſecond is clear from</hi> Rom. 11.16. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Both which places are of a like conſideration, and have the ſame ſenſe and meaning; and for the latter, it is I ſuppoſe miſtaken, when it is expounded to be the ſame with that which is ſpoken before, of Infidels perſons ſanctified to the beleever, ſo as that the beleever might dwell with the Infidell daily; for if the meaning were ſo, then the Apoſtles argument Were none at all; for this might be queſtioned in the nature of the thing as well as the former, and therefore if he intended nothing elſe, he ſaid nothing to clear the Generall, and the ſcruple from thence. Beſides the Apoſtle ſaith two things; firſt, that</hi> to the pure, all things are pure and ſanctified, <hi>therefore a beleeving husband or wife might dwell With an Infidell yoke-fellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond thing is, that by vertue of a beleevers eſtate in grace, all his fruit is holy, and partakers of the ſame ſtate of grace with him; unleſſe they do by ſome evill act of theirs deprive themſelves of it, as</hi> Eſau <hi>and</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>and ſuch like have done. The Apoſtle ſpeaking therefore of a twofold holineſſe, the one not in the thing it ſelf, but to anothers uſe; the other of the thing it ſelf, it cannot be but ſinfull for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them. Thus lies the argument, and the grounds proving the ſame Word for word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to which, I ſhall firſt call over again the Argument it ſelf, and ſpeak a word to that, and then more fully examine the truth of it in the grounds alledged to prove the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Argument thus: there is one and the ſame conſideration of the firſt fruits and the lump, the root and the branches. But the firſt fruits and root beleeving parents are holy, and muſt be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Therefore Infants the lump and branches are holy alſo, and muſt be baptiſed. Let the wiſe hearted Reader obſerve the fallacie in this Propoſition, &amp; the ſtrength which bears up all the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that is laid upon the ſame, is onely taken for granted without proof. Firſt for the root that is here taken for granted, but no way proved to be beleeving parents, which I deny as hereafter I ſhall manifeſt to the contrary by Gods aſſiſtance. Secondly, that Infants are put for the lump and branches, which I alſo deny, as in due place will appear. Theſe being preſuppoſed, the argument is grounded upon the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>As the firſt fruits are holy, ſo is the lump: and the root being holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> Gathering from hence, that as the firſt fruits to God did ſanctifie all the reſt of the ſame lump; ſo beleeving parents ſanctifie all their ſeed that proceeds from their loyns. And ſo as the firſt fruits, and the root being beleeving parents are holy: even ſo the lump and branches being their Infants are holy alſo, and ſo to be baptiſed as their parents are; which is a meer fallacie, and farre from the intent of the Apoſtle in thoſe words. And for our better underſtanding of the ſame, let us a little examine the Scriptures alledged: and firſt for <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. The generall ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe in this Chapter is concerning the Jews brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off, and the occaſion of it; as alſo their calling by the Goſpel, who were the people of God in a two fold conſideration. Firſt, as they were a nationall people according to the fleſh, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward priviledges ſutable to the ſame; by which God declared himſelf to be their God, and they his people above all others in the world. Secondly, ſome of them God owned in a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, with reference to his gracious covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and his ſeed after him for an everlaſting covenant: As <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. which conſideration cannot be of the Jews nationally conſidered, as I have formerly proved. For if ſo, then all the whole nation muſt have been in a true and ſaving eſtate of grace; and ſo all of them to have been ſaved,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40204:11"/>or elſe to fall from an eſtate of grace. So that as God had then a nationall Church and people, even ſo had he for the ſame alſo nationall priviledges both for order, ordinances and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which order cannot now be expected for us Gentiles under the new Teſtament: and though that God admitted them all alike to the outward priviledges in the type, yet God had another conſideration of them in reſpect of the ſubſtance; as not to approve of them all in his holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. Yet of that whole body in generall, <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh was the ſtock or root from whom they ſprong as naturall branches, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. Which nationall people muſt be conſidered in a two-fold reſpect. Firſt, a civill ſtate or common-wealth under a civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Kings, Judges, and other the like Governers of that nature. Secondly, a Church conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an holy Aſſembly of worſhip and worſhippers: and ſo a ſpirituall ſtate with the like go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and governors; as Prieſts, prophets, and the like of that nature. All which held fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion together, becauſe God took into one body that whole Nation for his own people. Or rather one head comprehending them all, which was <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom they deſcended as children ſpringing from the loyns of a father. All which ſo ſpringing out of his loyns did aſſume to themſelves an equall right and priviledge in Gods gracious covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, ſuppoſing God had bound his covenant generally upon him and his ſeed in his naturall generation after the fleſh. But God reſpecting in the ſame onely his choſen in Chriſt, with whom he confirmed his Covenant with <hi>Iſaac</hi> in reference to Chriſt. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Who in Gods own time he cals them to the faith, that they might appear to whom they belong, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 28.29, 30. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4 6. Theſe the Apoſtle ever defends againſt the generall rejection of that nation. For though ſuch were rejected as were not elected, this made not the promiſe of God of none effect to thoſe who ſtood firm in the covenant by grace in Chriſt Jeſus as branches in their root. Which grace the reſt oppoſed, and were caſt off for their unbeleef: and when the fulneſſe of Gods time is come to call them to belief, they ſhall be received again into their former eſtate as alive from the dead, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.23, 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Apoſtle after he hath proved the rejection of the Jews, he labours to make good the faithfulneſſe of God in his promiſe of grace, and the effectuall power of the Goſpel in the ſaving effects thereof in ſuch as beleeved through grace, though the Jews in their nationall reſpect were rejected, and ſo few of them gained to the truth: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. And he gives a reaſon of it thus: though that the Jews were all under an outward form of profeſſion of Gods name and truth, and ſo his people in that reſpect; yet there was but a remnant that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of in the Covenant according to his election of grace, unto whom the promiſe of life did belong. As <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5.7. Now to theſe Gods ſpeciall care is to perform his Covenant, and all that he promiſed to them in their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> with reference to Chriſt, in whom as the root God eſtabliſhed his holy Covenant for theſe his holy branches. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.12.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26.2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. Now the lump generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, comprehends all, both the firſt fruits and the latter: for except the firſt fruits were part of the lump, it could not give teſtimonie that the lump was holy; which lump ſo conſidered is Gods elect, and choſen in Chriſt, with reference to their beleeving in him: and ſo the approved ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Gods gracious Covenant, and heirs apparent to the kingdom of Chriſt. In which ſence God had one and the ſame reſpect unto all, and every part of the ſame lump, and that was as he conſidered the ſame in a conformitie to his Son, as the end of his election. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.29, 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.8.4.5, 6.1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1, 2. So that there is in the ſubſtance of truth one and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in the firſt fruits and the lump, according to what is laid down in the propoſition; the lump being as aforeſaid a remnant according to Gods election, with reference to faith, and ſo approved ſubiects in his holy covenant, appearing in <hi>Abrahams, Iſaacs</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> beleeving as the firſt fruits of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now as thoſe firſt fruits of that bleſſed crop in Gods holy Covenant were holy onely ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40204:12"/>(for we ſpeak of viſible things) ſo is the lump out of which theſe firſt appeared by faith, as a part of the ſame alſo holy in the ſame conſideration. Again, the lump which the Apoſtle ſpake of, is to be underſtood of the Jews, and not of the Gentiles, as he here applies it; For though he ſpeaks to the Gentiles, yet here he ſpeaks of the Jews. For in the Chapter before labours to provoke the Jews to receive the Goſpel, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. Therefore he intends the Jews by the firſt fruits of the lump. The firſt fruits the beleeving fathers, as aforeſaid, that firſt appeared in the Covenant of grace, in ſuch a way by faith, and ſo holy was that remnant which God had ſtill among them, with reference to the ſame ſtate the firſt fruits were in, and ſo holy; the ſame conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is to be had of the lump, with reference to that ſtate which God in his time ſhall call them unto by his Goſpel, and ſo are holy alſo: for this muſt reſpect a viſible holineſſe ſutable to that in the firſt fruits, otherwiſe it makes nothing for the thing in hand.</p>
            <p>All which well conſidered, will leave no place for Infants in this lump according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles intent; for look what were the ſubjects of Gods election, the ſame is the ſubject matter of this lump. But the firſt were perſons conſidered in Chriſt by faith, as hath been proved, and therefore theſe the ſame and not Infants. As <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if any Will ſay that ſuch as are elected and after come to beleeve, they Were firſt Infants and then elected, and beloved of God, and ſo holy in their infancie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it may be ſaid of the reprobate, that he is firſt an infant, and the ſame in his infancie: but we are to walk by a rule, and to judge of perſons by the word of god, and therein to ſee who they are that god by his Word approves of; and we to do the ſame, and then as the Word of God condemnes none but with reſpect to actuall ſin, no more doth it juſtifie any without reſpect to actuall faith, and ſo to ſee in the Goſpel what perſons the ſame approves of to be true ſubjects of grace, ſuch as may be juſtified, and juſtly imputed members of the body of Chriſt, redeemed by his blood, and ſo true heirs of glory, and to be inveſted into all the priviledges of grace by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Now whether the Goſpel inrights or admits any perſons unto theſe holy priviledges, without reſpect to their actuall beleeving in Chriſt: but this no where appears in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the onely will of Chriſt that is now in force, for the approving or declaring the lawfull ſubjects of the ſame; therefore no infants there admitted, untill they appear beleevers in Chriſt, and ſo the ſecond fruits of the lump, anſwerably to the firſt fruits: for the firſt fruits ever imply a ſecond of the ſame kind. As 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.20.23. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. and 8.23.</p>
            <p>Now for the root and branches, a word or two of that alſo.</p>
            <p>By root here, is that from which the Jews were cut off, and the Gentiles grafted in; and that is not onely I eleeving parents, and ſo the ſame with the firſt fruits, as the argument affirmes, but Chriſt myſtically conſidered, with reference to the rules of order, ordinances and government, laid down in the new Teſtament, for all ſuch to beleeve, and ſubmit unto, that God approves true ſubjects of the ſame. In reſpect of which Chriſt is called a Vine, a root, and the foundation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.5.22.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. Upon which founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the true prepared matter for the building is laid, which are ſuch as have a diſcernable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace and faith, by which they are onely capable ſiances to be grafted in the ſtock or root, and to be joyned as members to their head, and ſo becomes an orderly body, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. In which reſpect it is called the houſhold of faith, the Church of God, and the body of Chriſt: <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. Which body conſiſting of particular members, as ſo many branches abiding in their olive tree, vine and root, Chriſt their head; who as the root feeds the whole body, ſo with nouriſhment and fatneſſe, that every branch receiving of the ſame by faith becomes fruitfull. As <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.15.16. That the root is meant Chriſt as aforeſaid, with reference to the rules of the Goſpel, and ſo as he is laid as the foundation of the new Teſtament appears in this: firſt in that he is the root or olive-tree, cut of which the Jews are caſt, and the Gentiles grafted in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17.19.23.24.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:40204:12"/>
            <p>Secondly, in that the Apoſtle charges the Gentiles if they boaſt in themſelves againſt the Jews, they bear not the root, but the root them: <hi>ver.</hi> 18. that is, thou appeareſt not to have the truth of grace, and ſo not the true nature of the root and life of Chriſt in thy heart, but onely an outward forme of the profeſſion of him. As <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the conſideration of that which the Jews refuſed, and the Gentiles received, which was Chriſt aforeſaid. Therefore it is Chriſt in his myſticall order and government amongſt his Saints, that is here the root and olive tree, with his Spirit in his ordinances, iſſuing forth ſap and fatneſſe of life and comfort into every beleeving heart as a branch of the ſame.</p>
            <p>This will yet more clearely appeare, and conſider what was the Jewes owne naturall roote and Olive tree, whereof they were naturall branches, onely by faith, as the Apoſtle ſo declares them, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21, 24. which was union and communion onely with God in all his divine ordinances of worſhip, the manner and forme of which was that moſaicall and typicall order of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which reſpect the Jews were the firſt that ever God tooke in communion with himſelfe in ſuch a noly way of worſhip, and therefore called the firſt fruits of his love in that reſpect, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall branches. Which order and manner of worſhip (but not the matter) being changed at the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, and a new forme and order ſet up by him, called the Goſpel or new Teſtament, which order they oppoſed and were rejected: thus was Chriſt the precious tryed corner ſtone, and ſure foundation laid <hi>Sion;</hi> as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. And was to the Jew a ſtumbling ſtone, and rock of offence; as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.11. For which the Kingdome was taken from them; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41, 42, 43. That is, they were caſt out of fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in reſpect of his worſhip and ſervice for this their unbeliefe, and the Gentiles that did ſubmit to the Goſpel were taken in, for the worſhippers of God under the new Teſtament, and ſo ſtand in relation to God, as heires of the Kingdome both of grace and glory by faith in Chriſt. And when God pleaſes to call them by the Goſpel to beleeve in his Sonne, and ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to him, as he is the Mediatour of the new Teſtament, then ſhall they be received againe into their old fellowſhip and communion with God, as of old, to ſerve and worſhip him againe, according to the orders and rules of Chriſt in the Goſpel, as of old they did according to the order and rules of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law.</p>
            <p>And thus the Apoſtle proves their firſt eſtate to be holy, as firſt fruits of that holy and bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they ſtood into God by faith. From which for their unbeliefe they are cut off, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by faith admitted in, of meere grace, and not to boaſt: and yet there is a remnant of them to be called as the lumpe, and a ſecond fruit, which are alſo holy in reference to the firſt fruit of the ſame holy root, as aforeſaid. And as the roote it ſelfe is holy, ſo ſhall theſe branches be when they come to be grafted in againe to their owne roote or Olive tree, as at the firſt, which is union and communion with God in his holy way of worſhip, under the Goſpel as of old under the Law. And ſo much for the roote or Olive tree, which muſt be underſtood of Chriſt myſtically conſidered, and not of beleeving parents, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Now a word of the branches, which cannot be meant of Infants, but beleevers onely in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſenſe, being holy.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are branches onely in the ſame conſideration as they ſubſiſt and grow in the roote or Vine, and ſo beare the true nature of the ſame, by which they appeare to be holy, by the fruits thereof. Chriſt, as aforeſaid, being the roote or vine, the branches can no way be ſaid to ſubſiſt and to grow in him as their roote, but onely by ſaith, and he in them by his spirit, without which there is no holines in the Apoſtles ſence, who ſpeaks of ſuch as holines as is produced in the branch, by the holy roote, in which ingrowes and ſo partakes of the nature of the roote, by vertue of the union and communion it hath with the ſame; all which is by ſaith, as the Word reveales.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is no branch that is alive in the Vine, but partakes of the life and ſap of the ſame, by vertue of which the branch though never ſo young and ſmall, is diſcovered to be alive,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40204:13"/>and inabled to bring forth, in its ſeaſon, ſuch fruit as by which the ſame may be diſcerned: ſo it is here by theſe ſpirituall branches, they cannot properly be called branches in the Apoſtles ſence, but as they partake of the life and grace of Chriſt their true vine and olive tree, by which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the leaſt to be alive in him by faith, and inabled by the ſame to bring forth ſuch fruits as may diſcover them to be in the Covenant of grace, and ſo to be admitted unto the priviledges thereof, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1.7. Nature it ſelfe teaches as much, for no man will admit of dead plants to be ſet in his vineyard, or grafted into a ſtock, but onely ſuch as are capable to comply with the ſame, in the ſap, and nouriſhment thereof, to the end it may grow and bring forth fruit: and ſo it is with Chriſt, who comes not ſhort of nature, and therefore he admits not of any dead plants to be ſet in his ſpirituall vineyard, or dead members to be joyned to his myſticall body, but onely ſuch as by faith capable to comply with the head. Neither took he for himſelf a compounded body, conſiſting of both living and dead members, which all are that have not a living principle of grace &amp; faith in him, which all beleevers Infants have not; nor any at all, untill they are borne againe of the Spirit, as <hi>Job.</hi> 3.5, 6. The Church of God, which is the myſticall body of Chriſt, is not a mixt company, but onely one ſubſtantiall and royall ſubſtance, ſutable to her head &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which ſhee was produced, being the immortall ſeed of the Word; and therefore one holy ſpirituall uniforme compacted body, both for nature and forme, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. to 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. All which conſidered, proves the body of Chriſt, or Church of God under the new Teſtament, not to conſiſt of Infants, neither in whole nor in part; and ſo the branches aforeſaid, not to be underſtood of Infants, but beleevers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if any object from the words of Christ,</hi> Mat. 18.6. <hi>ſpeaking there of ſome little ones that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in him, and from thence gather that Infants have faith, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwer in a word is this; That I am for all that beleeve, and onely for them, whether they be Infants or others; ſo that their faith be viſible, as it may be diſcerned, otherwiſe it concerns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the point in hand; for we are upon viſible things, ſuch as may be judged of by the Word of God. Againe, little children that beleeve, in the Scripture ſenſe, are ſuch as be little and weake in the faith, and ſo babes in Chriſt; as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is ſaid, that the Church of the Jewes of old, and the Church of the Gentiles now, are one in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they are both the Church of God, and ſo Infants in the one, as they were in the other, and the ſame priviledges to the one, as to the other, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have before ſhewed the large difference between the Jewes and the Gentiles, in reſpect of their outward priviledges; but a word or two more, and ſo end. The Church of God under the old Teſtament, and that now under the new, for nature are one, in reference to the Elect of God, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the faith, and by the ſpirit of grace united to Chriſt, as the branches to their vine, and ſo an holy plant of Gods planting; of which indeed the true Church of Chriſt conſiſts; and therefore God did ever put a diſtinction in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, even from <hi>Abraham</hi> to Chriſt; as in <hi>Abraham,</hi> between <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael, Gen.</hi> 17.20, 21. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.11, 12, 13. in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau. Gen.</hi> 25.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. in <hi>Jacob,</hi> between <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> Gen. 48.13, 14.16, 17, 18, 19. And thus the holy Ghoſt figuratively pointed at a difference in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, between the children of the fleſh, &amp; the children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. and though God did thus diſtinguiſh in <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſteritie yet there could not be the like dividing in the ſame, they being nationall people, conſiſting both of a Church, and ſo ſpirituall, and of a common wealth, and ſo all under a civill worldly government. Which nation God crowned with many outward priviledges, as he never did any people in the earth, they being the firſt people that God ever tooke into covenant with himſelfe in ſuch a way; by whom he raiſed himſelfe a name and ſame in all the world, and ſo his peculiar treaſure, to whom he committed great matters of truſt, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. &amp; 9.4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. Of whom came Chriſt the Saviour of man, and therefore ſalvation is ſaid to be of the Jewes; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.22. In reſpect of which there was a bleſſed promiſe paſſed upon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40204:13"/>the Jews, for the bringing forth of the Meſſias, and the promiſed ſeed, in whom all Nations ſhould be bleſſed. And therefore all of that nation were admitted to the outward priviledges, as figures of him which that Nation was to bring forth: ſo that a fruitfull wombe was counted a great bleſſing among the Jews, not knowing who might be ſo honoured as to bring forth that bleſſed and all bleſſing ſeed. And therefore God honoured the naturall birth among the Jews, with ſuch outward bleſſings and priviledges that belongs not to the Gentiles at all. The Gentiles now are to look for their bringing forth of Chriſt according to the Spirit, as the Jews did then according to the fleſh: and likewiſe their birth, and their ſeed in all things ſutable to the ſame. As <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.5, 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, 13. and therefore we are ſaid now to know no man after the fleſh, no nor Chriſt himſelf as the Jews did, not Chriſt himſelf after the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was one priviledge of the fleſh; as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5. Therefore though that the Jews infants were admitted to all thoſe outward priviledges being a nationall people, and ſo a nationall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, with a naturall birth, and the like ſeed in generall, yet the Gentiles infants cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their ſpirituall priviledges, they being a perſonall people, called by the Word of grace, and ſo a ſpirituall body with a ſpirituall birth, and the like ſeed.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. which makes nothing for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing of Infants, but altogether againſt the ſame, the words not being well conſidered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore miſapplied; the firſt fruits being ſuch as firſt ſo appeared of Gods elect by faith in ſuch a way of grace by gods receiving and approving of them in his holy covenant, under ſo many gracious promiſes. The lump, ſuch a remnant in the election of grace, chiefly of the Jews, with reference to the ſame ſtate of grace and faith in Chriſt, as the firſt fruits were in, when God ſo approved of them. And ſo a ſecond fruits following the firſt fruits of the ſame kind, which firſt fruits did ever preſuppoſe the ſame. And ſo for the root and branches, the root Chriſt myſtically conſidered as aforeſaid, as the Scriptures hold him forth. The branches ſuch as grow in him by faith, and he in them by his Spirit, by which they are alive in their vine. All which are underſtood of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and not of Infants, and ſo with reſpect to their calling and not to their infancy; as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. which promiſe is in no other ſence to the children then to the parents; and that is either to turn them from their ſins, by calling them to repentance. As <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19 20.25 26. or to comfort them ſo turned; or repenting by tendring and applying to them the promiſed Saviour Chriſt Jeſus; as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.23.26 32, 33.38, 39. And as God hath not grounded his election of grace in the ſeed of beleevers, but in the good pleaſure of his will: no more hath he the diſpenſation of the ſame in his gracious Covenant, but in his free and effectuall call to beleeve in his Son, in whom they were elected to the ſame, which call to the faith makes the onely difference between them and others, and not their being the ſeed of beleevers by a naturall birth. For we are alike by nature, children of wrath as well the ſeed of beleevers as any others, conſidered in any perſonall reſpect; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 3. Whoſe happineſſe depends upon that bleſſed change, and ſpirituall birth by which they are born again, and called to beleeve in the Lord of life; and not their being the ſeed of a beleeving parent; for ſo one may be and periſh as ſoon as any others.</p>
            <p>And now for the other Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. if this be of the ſame conſideration with the former, then the ſame is anſwered with that and ſo they are both void in reſpect of the end for which they are alledged, namely, to prove the holineſſe of infants being in the Covenant of grace and life, by vertue of their being the children of beleeving parents, and ſo to have right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. But I do not underſtood this Scripture to be of the ſame conſideration with the former, and therefore a word or two of this alſo.</p>
            <p>And for the underſtanding of the Apoſtle in the ſame, its good firſt to conſider what that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is which inrights perſons to the priviledges of grace, and that is one of theſe two at the leaſt; Either the holineſſe of Chriſt in whom God looks upon his children, and approves of them holy in him, and ſo to have right through his Son to all things both in grace and glory. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40204:14"/>generation, appearing in the holy fruits and effects thereof, by which ſuch perſons appear, to to have right to the aforeſaid priviledges, before men who muſt judge of the tree by the fruit, and of both by the Word of God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.14. There is no other holineſſe that proceeds from Gods holy Covenant, or that can inright to any priviledge of grace now under the Goſpel. For whatſoever can truly inright any perſon to the priviledges of grace, the ſame inrights to glory. For no leſſe can inright to grace, then what inrights to glory. So that if this be ſuch a holineſſe, then look how many it inrights to Baptiſme, it alſo inrights to glory: and ſo all that are baptiſed, being children of beleevers, and ſo holy, muſt be ſaved or elſe fall from grace. But neither of theſe d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I beleeve for truth, and therefore this holineſſe muſt be ſome other holineſſe then that which tends to life eternall. It is ſaid, the unbeleeving wife is holy, or ſanctified which is all one by the husband; and the unbeleeving husband by the wife: and if it were not ſo, your children would be unclean alſo; but in that the unbeleeving husband and wife is holy by the beleevers, ſo are your children by the ſame means holy likewiſe. For the ſame way the children would be unclean, by the ſame rule of contraries they are holy. But if unbeleeving husband were not ſanctified by the wife, and the unbeleeving wife by the beleeving husband; now if they were not thus ſanctified the one to the other, that ſo they might lawfully continue together as husband and wife, their children would be unclean, in that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in an unlawfull way, for here the uncleanneſſe of the unbeleeving and unſanctified parents if in caſe they were ſo: and the uncleannes of the children is the ſame: even ſo on the contrary, the unbeleeving husband being ſanctified by the beleeving wife, that ſo they may lawfully continue together in that honourable way of marriage, and the bed undefiled, hence your children are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Which holineſſe of the children and the ſanctitie of the unbeleeving parents is the ſame; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the uncleanneſſe in oppoſition to the ſame. So that as the one is uncleanneſſe of the fleſh, ſo is the other the holineſſe of the fleſh, compared with theſe together: <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2.3. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. and 7.1, 2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 4. And for the two-fold holineſſe that is noted in the Argument to be conſidered in the Apoſtles words, the one not in the thing it ſelf but to another uſe; and the other of the thing it ſelf, and therefore ſin to confound them.</p>
            <p>This is in part true, for the holineſſe of the children is not onely ſuch a relative holineſſe as to another uſe, as the unbeleever to the beleevers uſe, and no more; but the holineſſe of the children reſts in themſelves, as the ſubjects thereof by nature, being begotten and born in that lawfull and honourable way of marriage by Gods appointment, and ſo holy and clean in oppoſition to ſuch as are begotten and brought forth in a way of uncleanneſſe, as adultery, fornication, and the like. And whereas it is ſaid, that if this were the meaning of the Apoſtle, then he ſaid nothing for the clearing of the ſcruple, becauſe this holineſſe of the children might be queſtioned as well as their own, &amp;c. To which I anſwer, and ſay, that to expound the Apoſtle this way, makes onely forth clearing of the ſcruple, which ſcruple befell the Corinthians by reaſon of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which the Apoſtle writ to them before, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 9. wherein he ſo preſſes them from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any communion or fellowſhip with any unclean perſon, in the worſhip of God; which they underſtood of civill commerce with the world, upon which they queſtioned the lawfull retaining of their unbeleeving husband and wives, and to have communion with them in that neer relation of husband and wife in their civill commerce and ſocietie. And ſo much the more, having an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the like nature in the Law. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.7. about which thing they wrote to the Apoſtle for information, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and queſtioned not their children. Whereby it appears they held it lawfull for to retain their children. To which the Apoſtle anſwers from a double ground, thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that all things are ſanctified to ſuch as beleeve; as <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. and ſo is the unbeleeving wife to the beleeving husband. So that you may lawfully live together in that comfortable eſtate and ſocietie of marriage which God hath ordained for man and wife to abide in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you judge your ſelves to live in ſuch a way of uncleanneſſe upon which you muſt now part, then your children ſo begotten are unclean, and to be put away alſo but in that you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40204:14"/>it lawfull to retain your children, and not to put them away though you beleeve, and they do not. Then much more the unbeleeving parents as aforeſaid that bear them: for if the effect be holy, then muſt the cauſe be alſo holy that produceth the ſame; which is Gods holy ordinance of marriage, and not his holy covenant of grace. Now it had been in vain for the Apoſtle to have gone about to prove the lawfull reſtraining of the unbeleeving husband and wife from the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their children being in the Covenant; for nothing was more clear then this, that ſuch children as are begotten in uncleanneſſe were not approved of in Gods holy Covenant of life, not any way holy either by Law or Goſpel. How then could this tend to remove the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſcruple, to tell them they might lawfully continue together, becauſe their children were in the Covenant of grace and life, and ſo were holy; when as their ſcruple lay in matter of uncleanneſſe upon which they were to part. Now this muſt firſt be cleared, whether they were ſo or not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of themſelves, before ever they could beleeve the holineſſe of their children, or any ſuch to be in Gods gracious Covenant: for the children of adultery and fornication are debarred the holy Covenant both in the Law and Goſpel. But if it be ſaid that the ſcruple was about the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull commerce of the beleever with the unbeleever, and not of their marriage, as if they lived in adultery and fornication, and ſo the uncleanneſſe of the fleſh in that reſpect as if they were not married. Now if this be true, that they ſcruple not their marriage; then it holds true alſo, that they did not queſtion the lawfull retaining of their children: And ſo the Apoſtles argument from the ſame is of force to prove the lawfull continuing of their parents alſo; though the one called to the faith, and ſo a beleever, and the other not. In which reſpect they judged their children free from that uncleanneſſe the unbeleeving parent was or might be guiltie of: to which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle anſwers and affirms, that the condition of the parents and the children is one and the ſame in the aforeſaid reſpects. If they put away the one as unclean, upon the ſame ground the other is unclean, and to be put away alſo. And as the one is holy, and to be retained; upon the ſame ground the other is holy, and to be retained likewiſe.</p>
            <p>And I conclude as I began, tht the holineſſe here both of the unbeleeving parents and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is the ſame for nature, being oppoſed to one and the ſame uncleanneſſe, which is onely the holineſſe of the creature in a naturall reſpect; not the holineſſe of the gracious Covenant of life in a ſpirituall reſpect, as it is affirmed. And ſo this Scripture alſo hath nothing at all in it for the proving of Infants true ſubjects of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One thing more in the Propoſition I cannot paſſe, which is this:</hi>

            <p>A word briefly of this, and ſo I leave it as anſwered already.<note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. If this be a truth, then one may be ſaved by another mans faith; for here by vertue of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſtate in grace, all his fruit, that is, his children pertake of the ſame with him, and ſo fare as he doth, onely by vertue of his grace or ſtate in grace, which is the ſame. And ſo by the fathers ſaith the children ſhare together with him in that grace which his faith inſtates him in, which is ſalvation it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This doctrine takes away the being of originall ſinne, for here they are all holy, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of grace untill they commit ſome actuall ſinne. Which denies any originall ſin, for that would make them unholy, though they never committed actuall ſin in their own perſons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It layes a ground of falling out of an eſtate of grace; for by this doctrine <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and all beleevers children are holy, and partakers of the ſame grace with their parents, untill they commit ſin as <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did, and then to fall from the ſame as they did.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, this is falſe doctrine, for both <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> were excluded from being ſubjects of Gods ſaving grace before they committed actuall ſin.

Theſe are the holy ſeed, which God ſo approves of in the Scriptures, as ſubjects of grace, &amp; heires of life, and being in the covenant, they onely have right to the priviledges thereof; and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or of-ſpring are ſuch as ſucceed them in the ſame ſaith and truth, and ſo are called the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the righteous,</hi> as ſucceeding each other in the way of righteouſneſſe, and not their Infants or perſonall ſeed proceeding from their loyns by carnall generation, as <hi>Eſa</hi> 43.5 &amp; 44 3. &amp; 54.3. &amp; 59.21. &amp; 66.22. &amp; 61.9. &amp; 65.23. compare <hi>Rev</hi> 12.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. to 31.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like Scriptures ſhew what is the right and true approved ſeed, unto which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of grace belong: ſo that although Baptiſme ſucceeds Circumciſion, yet the difference is great, both in matter and manner in perſons and things. Circumciſion ſealed to things temporall and carnall, as well as ſpirituall, and ſo were the ſubjects, and things to come as under types and ſhadows, and ſo in a cloud and darkneſſe. Whereas Baptiſme hath for its ſubjects children of the light, in the cleare evidence of the Spirit, with the face open, and confirmes faith in things come, and already done; for Baptiſme ſeals onely to faith in Chriſt, and grace in the new birth, which cannot be, where there is not firſt a begetting by the immortall ſeed of the Word of life; for which end God hath ordained in the Goſpel preaching &amp; beleeving to goe before baptizing, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. with <hi>Mark</hi>

And that way or order which hath not God for its Author, and found in the Records of Chriſt with his image and ſuperſcription upon it, let us ſay as ſometime he did, <hi>Give to Caeſar that which is Caeſars, and to God that which is Gods;</hi> ſo ſay I, Give to Antichriſt his baptizing of Infants, &amp; to Chriſt, his baptizing of beleevers. What advantage will it be to Infants to come before they are called, to have a name to live, and yet dead for ought any one knows, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40204:15"/>to come to the marriage-Supper, without a wedding Garment, ſhall the holy things of God be forced upon ſuch, as neither beleeve, know, or once deſires them, will men ſet a ſeale to a blanke? are children capable to receive meate before they be borne, except we make Baptiſme the wombe of regeneration, as many doe, who teach that Infants are regenerated &amp; borne againe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace in Baptiſme, whoſe doctrine is of the ſame ſtampe and authoritie, as he that ſent them ſo to preach. What can be more naturall, then begetting and bringing forth of the Infant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feeding of it at the Mothers breaſts? Is it not ſacriledge to preſſe ſuch upon the wiſe of Chriſt the Church, for her Paps, with whom ſhe never travelled, or beare of her body? Chriſt will deny himſelfe to be food and nouriſhment to any, where he hath not beene firſt ſeed to beget. Let men take heed how they impute ſuch folly to the wiſdome of god, as to give the milke of his breaſts unto any that are ſtill borne, or to ſet dead twigs in his heavenly and divine ſtocke, or naturall branches in his holy and ſpirituall vine. Let ſuch beware how they fight againſt the God of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, leaſt in ſtead of finding the breaſt to feed before the wombe to beare, they meet with a curſe upon the ſingle emptineſſe of Chriſt, with a double barrenneſſe, that will admit of no conception or ſpirituall birth to ſucceed the naturall. Not that I intend the leaſt to deny ſalvation unto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, no, I am ſo far from this, that I teſtifie againſt all ſuch doctrine, nor yet affirme all Infants to be ſaved, neither doe I know among Infants, which ſhall be ſaved, and which not, therefore I leave it as a ſecret thing to God, untill he makes the ſame appeare by ſome viſible effect of faith, which onely gives a viſible right unto any ordinance of the new Teſtament: and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee by the Goſpel, how Infants voyde of viſible faith, ſhould have viſible right unto the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of grace; neither ought they to be admitted thereunto, as hath been proved; and alſo for theſe, and the like reaſons following.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> becauſe there is neither command nor example for the baptizing of Infants in all the new Teſtament: the order and government of which, in the adminiſtrations thereof, is no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the old; but in the old Teſtament there was an expreſſe Rule, by command from God, what communicants were to be admitted to circumciſion, and other ordinances of that nature, and what not; but this order is no where found in the new Teſtament for the baptizing of Infants, and therefore the ſame is not to be practiſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a high contempt and injury to Chriſt, as he is the husband of the Church his holy Spouſe, to force upon him an naturall wife, himſelfe being ſpirituall, and deſires the like aſſociate, as ſuch a Church is founded upon the naturall birth, namely, Infants, becauſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to one that is borne of the spirit, there is twenty borne of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a practiſe that overthrows, and deſtroys the body of Chriſt, or holy temple of God; for in time it will come to conſiſt of naturall, and ſo a nation, and ſo a nationall Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; carnall members, amongſt whom if any godly be, they will be brought in bondage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubjects of ſcorn &amp; contempt, and the power of government reſt in the hands of the wicked.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauſe it is a ground both of ignorance and errour, for it holds people in blindnes, that they cannot come to know the nature of that holy ordinance, nor what the ſame requires in the ſubjects thereof: &amp; alſo it cauſes the ſimple to conceive that Baptiſme is of neceſſity to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it keeps up the State of Antichriſt, by granting him this ſo chiefe a corner-ſtone of the Lords houſe to lie in his foundation; for that church where Baptiſme is the true ordinance of God, in the adminiſtration thereof, is by the Rules of the Goſpel a true Church; ſo that, if Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Baptiſme which he adminiſters be Gods ordinance, then that Church wherein he doth ſo adminiſter the ſame, muſt be alſo the Church of God, and in ſin that refuſeth communion with it.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Becauſe it builds faith upon humane teſtimony in matters fundamentall; for ſuch as are baptized in their infancy, have no other way to ſatisfie either themſelves, or others, but the bare word of man, that muſt ſtand in the place of the word of God, for ſuch to beleeve their true recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſo holy ordinance of God.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40204:16"/>
            <p>Seventhly, To Baptize Infants, makes the holy ordinance of God a lying ſigne, becauſe none of thoſe things can be expected in an Infant which the ſaid ordinance holds forth or ſignifies in the adminiſtration thereof, which is the parties regeneration and ſpirituall new birth; a dying and burying with Chriſt in reſpect of ſin, and a riſing with him in a new life to God, and a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and a free remiſſion of ſinne by the ſame; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> None of all which can be expected in an Infant.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Becauſe the ſubject of Baptiſme is to be paſſive, but an Infant is no way paſſive, as that ordinance requires.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> I meane a paſſive ſubject threefold: 1. a thing uncapable, and thus is a ſtone. 2. a thing forced, and thus is an Infant, who oppoſeth its Baptiſme to the utmoſt of its abilitie, ſo farre is it from being paſſive in the ſame. 3. A thing is paſſive by a ſubjecting power producing the ſame in the ſubject, by bringing it to a free and voluntary ſubjection; and thus is the true ſubject of Baptiſme. None can be paſſive to receive grace, but by grace, becauſe it conſiſts of ſelfe-deniall.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, this doctrine of Infants Baptiſme oppoſes directly the expreſſe word of God, by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that Infants are in the covenant of grace, being borne of beleeving parents, and ſo an holy ſeed, by vertue of which they have right to Baptiſme as a priviledge of grace. Againſt which the holy Ghoſt affirmes, that all are conceived in ſinne, brought forth in iniquitie, and ſo by nature children of wrath, and under the curſe, and except they be borne againe from above, they cannot ſee the Kingdome of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5 <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 10.13, 14. <hi>Job.</hi> 3.3.5, 6. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.12, 13. Here man ſaith, that Infants are cleane and holy, in and from the wombe, and ſo are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of grace and glory: but God ſaith that all Infants as well one as another, are firſt in ſinne, and unholy, and ſo are ſubjects of wrath, untill the ſecond birth makes the difference; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5.6. And now which to beleeve, let the upright heart to God judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is ſaid, that as the Covenant was made to the Jews and their ſeed under the old Teſtament, ſo in the ſame manner doth the Apoſtle apply the ſaid Covenant to beleevers and their ſeed in the new Teſtament; as</hi> Act. 2.39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The words are not, unto your ſeed, but unto your children: wherein there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For by ſeed in the Scripture is very often put for a naturall generation, begotten and born after the fleſh. And by children, a ſpirituall generation, walking in the ſteps of the faith of ſuch as have gone before them: as <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.26.33. and ſo <hi>Job.</hi> 8.37.39. with <hi>Rim.</hi> 9.7 8. and ſo the words import as much, which is to you and to your children, and to all afarre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. So that the promiſe is onely to ſuch as God ſhall call, and to none elſe.</p>
            <p>Again, its called the promiſe, and not the Covenant; and we know that every promiſe is not a covenant: there being a large difference between a promiſe and a covenant. And now let it be well conſidered what is here meant by the promiſe, and that is Gods ſending of the Meſſias or the ſeed in whom the Nations ſhould be bleſſed; and ſo the ſending of a Saviour or Redeemer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iſrael, as theſe Scriptures manifeſt compared together: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. with <hi>Luke</hi> 1.68.74. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25.26. This was performed by Chriſts coming firſt in the fleſh, in which reſpect he came both of and to the Jews onely by promiſe: as <hi>Joh</hi> 4.22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Matth,</hi> 10.5 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly in the preaching of the Goſpel, by which he was held forth as a Saviour to all that by faith laid hold upon him, as the arm of Gods grace ſtretched out unto them. And this way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Chriſt was firſt tendered to the Jews for a Saviour, to ſave them from their fins: <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. and for to be their King, as to ſave them: ſo unto whoſe ſtate and government they were to ſubmit, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14.27. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. In which ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks when he ſaith, the promiſe is to you and to your children, and to all farre and neer, as God ſhall call, that is, the promiſe or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour is come, and is now according to Gods promiſe tendered to you by the Goſpel, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you, and your children, and all elſe where the word of grace ſhall come, to beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40204:16"/>him by ſaith who is now come to ſave you, and all that beleeve from their ſins. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. 26. And therefore its ſaid, as many as gladly received, or beleeved this glad tidings, the ſame was ſealed, or confirmed unto them by baptiſme. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. according to <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11, 12 13. By all which it is manifeſt, that the promiſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. is meant the ſending of the Meſſias, or a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the houſe of Iſrael, to call them to repentance, and to ſave ſuch as beleeve from their ſins, as is clear alſo by theſe Scriptures. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.23.26 32.38.39. And thus the promiſe is unto you and your children, that is, the promiſed Saviour is offered, and offers himſelf freely to ſave you: notwithſtanding your crucifying of him, yet now repent and beleeve, for his promiſe is upon the ſame, freely to forgive, and to ſave you from all your ſins. Thus the promiſe is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſaith, which is the way of preaching the Goſpel, and not an abſolute concluſion of perſons to be in the covenant of grace and life, whether they have faith or not. What is this but to keep the wicked from leaving of his way, by promiſing him life. This God did not in making of his Covenant at the firſt, nor the Apoſtle by his applying of the ſame at the laſt. Otherwiſe to bring the perſonall or naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſo of all beleevers into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and that by Gods appointment, whoſe word i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> like himſelf, both true and ſtable as a word of faith; purely tried as gold ſeven times in the fire.</p>
            <p>Hence obſerve the evils that attend this doctrine unavoidably. Firſt it makes void the ſtability of Gods Covenant of grace it ſelf, thus: If the Covenant of grace be abſolute and ſtable, then all within the ſame muſt be ſaved. But all within the ſaid Covenant were not ſaved: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace is not abſolute and ſtable. The major is confeſſed, that a beleevers ſeed is in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace without exception. The minor is proved from <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and the rejected Jews, all which were the ſeed of beleevers, and yet not all ſaved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Its a ground of falling from grace, thus: All that God took into his Covenant of grace, were in an eſtate of grace. But all that God took into his Covenant of grace, did not there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch fell from an eſtate of grace. I prove this the ſame way with the former.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Its a ground of univerſall redemption, for it makes the death of Chriſt equall as well to ſuch as periſh as to ſuch as are ſaved: thus. All that are in the Covenant of grace, Chriſt died for. But all that were in the Covenant of grace were not ſaved. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt died for ſuch as are not ſaved. The proof of this is the ſame with the former, if God took <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed into his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace without exception.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It makes God the author of mans beleeving untruth, by injoyning him to beleeve the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſuch as he himſelf knows, and reveals the contrary: as <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> and but a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant among the Jews; nay none at all but ſuch as beleeve. <hi>Gen,</hi> 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. Againſt which opinion and evils aforeſaid, I argue thus. The Covenant of grace is abſolute and ſaving unto all once with in the ſame. But all the perſonall ſeed of beleevers are not ſaved: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all beleevers ſeed are not in the Covenant of grace. The Propoſition is clear from theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28.29. The Aſſumption from theſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 29.30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13.27. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no man to beleeve untruth. But for a beleever to beleeve that all his ſeed is in the Covenant of grace, is to beleeve untruth. Therefore God requires no ſuch thing. This Argument is ſully proved in the former. And ſo much for the promiſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. which being well underſtood, men would never go about to build the baptiſing of the Gentiles infants upon that Scripture.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid that Chriſt admits of little children to come unto him, bleſſing them, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their right unto the kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14. therefore ſuch may be baptiſed.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer briefly thus. That the bleſſing of Chriſt upon theſe children was for bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cures, as is manifeſt by the deſires of thoſe that brought them to Chriſt; which was not that he ſhould baptiſe them, but that he would touch them, and lay his hands upon them, and pray, as <hi>Mark</hi> 5.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13.15. This was the ordinary way of healing in the time of the Law
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40204:17"/>by ſuch as were inabled by God thereunto, as is clear by theſe Scriptures compared together. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 5.11. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9 18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.38.40. Never were any ſo brought to Chriſt but for ſome cure, and for his bleſſing of them; that was in reſpect of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall mercie he beſtowed upon them according to that they came to him for: and to ſhew his bountie and humilitie that he was no reſpecter of perſons; as ſuch might ſeem to be, that ſuffered others to come, and would have kept back children. And for ſuch to belong unto the kingdom, ſo thoſe children did, and therefore they ought to come as well as any other. For they were children of the Jews, and at that time members of that Church, and ſo of that kingdome; and had as much intereſt in Chriſt for outward bleſſings as any elſe.</p>
            <p>And further, Chriſt is pleaſed to make uſe of childrens humilitie and innocencie, to reprove the high mindedneſſe of his diſciples, and to draw them forth a pattern from the ſame. As <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, 4. with <hi>Mark</hi> 10.5.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> So that all this makes nothing for the baptizing of Infants: they being not brought to Chriſt for baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But its further objected, that the Apoſtles baptized whole houſholds, as the houſhold of</hi> Stephanas, Lydia, <hi>and the Jayler,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15 33. <hi>and infants being a part of the houſhold, therefore infants were baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though that Infants are a part of the family when there be infants in the ſame; yet this makes nothing for the baptizing of Infants, except it be firſt proved that infants were there in thoſe houſholds. And alſo upon the ſame ground we may prove that the Jayler had a wife, and <hi>Lydia</hi> an husband, becauſe that husbands and wives are commonly in a houſhold or family, and being there they are a part of the ſame. and that the Jaylers wife, and <hi>Lydias</hi> husband and ſervants, though never ſo wicked, were all baptiſed. But if it be ſaid that faith was to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them being of yeers. Hence it will follow, that no infants were then baptiſed, becauſe that one and the ſame condition is required of all that are baptiſed: and ſo it is ſaid of the Jayler, that the Word was preached to him, and to all that were in his houſe; and that he beleeved and all his houſe: and theſe are ſaid to be baptiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.32.34. and thus the Apoſtle preached, and they beleeved, and ſuch onely were baptiſed, and none elſe. And what the Apoſtles order and practiſe was in this family, it was the ſame in all other houſholds and families; for they walked alwayes by one rule: and therefore their order was not to baptiſe infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ſaid, that Chriſt ſent out his Apoſtles to teach and to baptize all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28.19. <hi>in which Nations there were infants as well as men of yeers, and ſo commanded to be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In a word briefly to this: for this Scripture being well conſidered, and rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, would ſtop mens mouthes for ever having a word to ſay for the baptizing of infants. This bleſſed commiſſion of Chriſt to his Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es was chiefly for us Gentiles, ſaying, <hi>All power is given me in heaven, and in earth.

So that here teaching goes before baptizing. and preſuppoſeth underſtanding and faith in that which is taught; this being the onely place of Chriſts inſtituting the ordinance of baptiſme. And further explained. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15.16. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature; he that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So that from theſe Scriptures brought to prove the baptizing of infants, it is clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that infants are not the ſubjects of baptiſme appointed by Chriſt: for all the externall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and priviledges of the Goſpel are given onely to externall and viſible faith. And ſo the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40204:17"/>ſealing and confirming ordinances of Chriſt, ever preſuppoſe faith in the ſubject, to ſeale unto, and to be confirmed. So that here is no ground for the baptizing of Infants, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>But it is affirmed by ſome, that as God commanded Infants to be circumciſed, and the ſame command remaining ſtill unrepealed, ſtands in force for Infants to be baptized. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſay, if that commandement muſt ſerve now without alteration, then we muſt circumciſe and not baptize, and that males onely, and not females; but if it be altered, then it hath not the ſame way to hold Infants forth in Baptiſme, as it had in Circumciſion; but that command, which injoyned circumciſion, is repealed by a direct command to the contrary, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any object, from the ſecond Commandement, injoyning the worſhip of God, though the ſaid worſhip of God be changed in reſpect of the manner and outward forme, yet the ſame commandement continues ſtill in force for the worſhip of God now as it did then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwer is, Theſe two commandements will no way agree ſo be compared; the ſecond commandement directly injoyned Gods worſhip, as the ſubſtance thereof, and ſo ſtill remaines, and alſo retaines the ſame thing it firſt commanded, being the worſhip of God. But now for the command that injoyned circumciſion, which was the ſubſtance of that command, is now cleane made voyde; for circumciſion in the fleſh is now aboliſhed, &amp; that in the heart come in the place; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. Againe, as the old outward forme of Gods holy worſhip under the old Teſtament was aboliſhed and done away, ſo likewiſe the new order and forme of Gods worſhip was erected and ſet up againe by ſpeciall command; and when the manner of it is once ſet downe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen the commandement comes on againe, and not before, and binds onely to that order and manner ſo erected, and ſet up, and to none elſe, ſo that now the new ſtate of the Church and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God being eſtabliſhed, and the ſubject of Baptiſme in the ſame, expreſſed to be a beleever. Now if that commandement comes on upon this ſtate, then it binds to this ſubject onely and to none other. And to hold the ſubject of Baptiſme by the ſame command, that injoyned circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without the ſaid ſubject being expreſſely ſet downe, and ſo confirmed and eſtabliſhed by the New Teſtament; this is more then will be granted in any other part of Gods worſhip injoyned, or comprehended in the ſecond commandement. All which ſay we, is ſo farre approved of by God, as is expreſſely ſet downe in the New Teſtament, or everlaſting Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But let us examine a little wherein the authoritie of that commandement of circumciſion may be, that is brought to beare out the baptizing of Infants: Circumciſion it doth not, for all agres that we are now to baptize, and not to circumciſe: the parties circumciſing it doth not, then the Maſter of the family to circumciſe; but now one authorized by Chriſt in his body the Church to baptize; the ſame part of the body it doth not, that the foreskin Baptiſme the whole man; the age it doth not, that the eight day, and this any day; the ſubject it doth not, that a male onely, this both male and female. Now in that it doth not injoyne none of all theſe, wherein then can the authoritie of that command conſiſt now in Baptiſme, ſo as to injoyne Infants to be baptized; for either it muſt be a thing indifferent, or elſe it muſt injoyne ſomething. And whereas men cry out from that command, Infants, Infants, Infants muſt be baptized as they were commanded to be circumciſed: why this command if it ſhould be ſo, ſerves for none but onely males; ſo that if they will have the female to be baptized, they muſt look out for another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement for them, and ſo there muſt be two commandements meet in one ordinance.</p>
            <p>But I would demand of ſuch as hold the baptizing of Infants from the command that injoyned circumciſion, that if in caſe there had been no word or command given for baptizing of any, whether that they, or any other, might have baptized either Infants or any others from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; but I ſuppoſe they will not ſo affirme, and if not, what doe man wander under the clouds of their own ignorance, when as the light ſhines ſo clearely, for what is more cleare then this, that the New Teſtament hath ſufficient expreſſe commands and rules for the adminiſtration
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40204:18"/>of Baptiſme, both for matter and manner, with out any reference, much leſſe dependency upon the law of Circumciſion, they being two diſtinct inſtitutions. At two ſeverall times there is given com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for Baptiſme; the firſt was <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who received his authoritie not from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Circumciſion, but had his Commiſſion expreſſely from God, who ſent him to baptize; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32, 33. And thoſe that he baptized are ſaid by the holy Ghoſt to be ſuch as manifeſted their faith and repentance; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.6. The ſecond Commiſſion which ſerves for us Gentiles, is that which Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. Which hath no reference to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of circumciſion, but by vertue of that power and authoritie given him of the Father, for the ordering and diſpoſing of all things in heaven &amp; earth, for his own glory and his peoples good. In which Commiſſion the ſubjects of Baptiſme are expreſſely ſet downe, who they ſhould baptize, and they are onely ſuch as firſt were to be taught, and had faith to beleeve the ſame, as I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved.</p>
            <p>And now having theſe expreſſe commands, ſo fully held forth by Chriſt himſelfe, to gether with the whole practicall order of the Apoſtles, &amp; others following the ſame in their adminiſtracions, and to goe about to bring authoritie or command from the commandement of circumciſion, for the baptizing of Infants, in more then ignorance, and for to plead the baptizing of Infants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that command is not repealed, which injoyned Infants to be circumciſed, is too weake for faith to build upon. But now I hope the removall of the ſame appears, in that there is not onely a command in the new Teſtament directly againſt the ſame, but alſo a new command, and ſo a law from Chriſt the King of Saints, and Lord of the new Teſtament, for the ordinance of Baptiſme, and all the circumſtances of the ſame. And yet for the further repealing of that law which injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Infants naturally borne, and ſo from the wombe to be circumciſed, without minding any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſprituall birth, but onely that which brought forth the childe in the world; for 8 dayes after it muſt be circumciſed by command from God; which order is oppoſed by the Goſpel, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. 5, 6. Where Chriſt oppoſeth the two births, the ſpirituall to the naturall birth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the naturall from any admittance into the Kingdom of God, without the ſpirituall birth. And that he might not be miſtaken, he further explains himſelf, ſaying, <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit.</hi> And further to know Chriſts meaning in theſe births, which he oppoſeth the one to the other, he fully holds forth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. in theſe words of ſuch as received him, <hi>which were borne, not of blond, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This way and order the commandement of circumciſion ſpeaks nothing of, neither required the ſame, but onely the firſt birth; for no childe of 8 dayes old was capable to be borne againe of the Spirit, in our Saviours ſenſe. And thus the Goſpel excludes that which the law of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commanded, even the firſt birth which is naturall, without the ſecond birth which is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And it is in vaine for any to ſay that Chriſt ſpeakes here of men of yeares; for he oppoſeth the two births, as aforeſaid, and not the age of any, and ſo the whole univerſe of mankinde: for this place is generally taken for the doctrine of regeneration, from whence many hold that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are regenerated in Baptiſme. But generally thoſe that baptize their Infants, hold that they are regenerated before, for they baptize them as being holy before. And if any ſhall ſay, that the Kingdome Chriſt ſpeaks of, is meant the Kingdome of glory, and not of grace; and therefore though he excludes ſuch out of the one, yet not out of the other. The anſwer is, that it is no where found in the Goſpel, that any are excluded the kingdome of glory, and yet are admitted into the kingdome of grace. The doore of grace in this ſenſe, is no wider then the gate of glory by Gods appointment: and what men doe through ignorance, that alters not the truth of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30.</p>
            <p>And if any ſay, that Chriſt at this time had oppoſed Gods ordinance of circumciſion if ſuch a truth had been put in execution, as is gathered from his words, to exclude and put by an Infant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:40204:18"/>
            <p>To this I anſwer, and ſay, that Chriſt ſpeaks of many things before his death, which did not concerne the time preſent, but of the order and government of his Church under the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſo he ſpeaks here of the qualification of his ſubjects and worſhippers in his new king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that was at hand; all which was to be ſpirituall, and therefore to be borne of the ſpirit, as Chriſt affirmed. In which ſenſe circumciſion in the fleſh ceaſed, and that of the heart onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Adde to this the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>We are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all by nature children of wrath:</hi> Now if this be true, then ſo long as nothing elſe appears, how can we judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, without gainſaying the holy Ghoſt; and by the words of Chriſt, we are firſt borne of the fleſh, and ſo in an eſtate of nature, untill grace recover us, and the effects of Chriſts redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes hold upon us. Untill which time we are judged of the Apoſtle <hi>to be children of wrath, and of the fleſh,</hi> and ſo uncleane, <hi>and no uncleane thing muſt come into the holy Citie of grace and glory, Rev.</hi> 21. All which being well conſidered, I thinke will put a ſtop to the commandement of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, from having any footing in the ordinance of Baptiſme, or for any to take a ground from thence to juſtiſie their Infants in their Baptiſme, untill ſome evidence appeares of their being inwardly waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt, that ſo the ſame may be confirmed unto them by that outward waſhing with water; otherwiſe the ordinance is no way availeable to them, but ſinne in ſuch as impoſe the ſame upon them, who doe neither deſire it, nor know what is done unto them, which is to ſet a ſeale to a blanke, a thing condemned in nature.</p>
            <p>And ſo I paſſe from this ſubject, of Infants Baptiſme, deſiring the Lord abundantly to extend his ſaving grace unto as many as belongs to him, that the praiſe may ever abound to his glory, and their everlaſting comfort in all happines and ſafetie here, and glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We know no man after the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. <hi>We are the circumciſion, that worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>Marvell not that I ſay, a man muſt be borne againe, before he can enter into the Kingdome of God,</hi> Joh. 3.</p>
            <p>And thus I deſire to have Infants ever in honourable and reverent reſpect, ſo farre as honour and reverence belongs unto them, and ſo leave them to the grace and good pleaſure of the God of all grace, who onely knows who are his, and hath the diſpoſing of them, and all his creatures to his own glory, ſo be it, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having examined the viſible right that infants have to baptiſme, and finding none by the Word of God but the contrary; I come now to a ſecond ſort, and they are ſuch as have been baptized in a falſe Antichriſtian eſtate, as they ſay, and ſo challenge right to enter upon or aſſume a true Church with the ſame baptiſme they received of the man of ſin. So that the thing I deal with now is onely that opinion which holds a ſtate to be falſe and Antichriſtian; and yet Baptiſme there adminiſtred by an Antichriſtian power to be the true ordinance of God: and ſo leave the ſtate as falſe, and retain their baptiſme received there as a true ordinance of God. And for a more orderly proceeding in this diſcourſe, I ſhall firſt ſet down my diſſent, and the cauſes of it; and then examine thoſe grounds that are brought for the proving of the contrary.</p>
            <p>And firſt for that ordinance of Baptiſme, which as aforeſaid hath been adminiſtred, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a falſe Antichriſtian eſtate, and retained the true ordinance of God; and ſuch ſo baptized by the power of the man of ſin, to be admitted into the Church of Chriſt with the ſame baptiſme as the Lords ordinance. This I cannot aſſent unto, becauſe I ſee no ſuch thing in all the Word of God, by which I muſt be guided here, and judged hereafter. So that I diſſent from that baptiſme adminiſtred by the power of Antichriſt, and cannot own the ſame for Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance appointed by him, and inſtituted by Chriſt in the new Teſtament, and that for theſe and the like reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe in ſo doing, I ſhall approve of Antichriſts matter and form,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and ſo of the ſtate it ſelf. As an infant for his matter, and the words with water applied, his form. I have alreadie proved that an infant is not the ſubject of baptiſme appointed by God, though it be the child of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40204:19"/>a beleever: but how much leſſe ſuch who are the carnall ſeed of the wicked. The covenant of grace and the parents faith is alledged to inright the former unto baptiſme; but what inrights theſe unto it, and how came they by it?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ordinance of baptiſme inſtituted by Chriſt is ſo eſſentiall to the conſtitution of the Church under the new Teſtament, that none can be true in her conſtitution without it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can that be a falſe Church where baptiſme is truly the Lords ordinance in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. So that to approve of Antichriſts baptiſme to be Gods ordinance, is to approve of his Church to be alſo the Church of God. For as the eaters of the ſacrifice were of old partakers of the Alcar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17, 18. and to receive him that is ſent is a receiving alſo of him that ſent him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.40. ſo it is with this eſſentiall ordinance of baptiſme in the church of Antichriſt; that whoſoever approves of the one, by the ſame he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of the other alſo. For the ground and piller that bears up the truth, and that truth ſo born up, ſtands and falls together: as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. So that where there is not a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e conſtituted Church, there is no true conſtituted Church ordinance: and where there is a true Church ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in its conſtitution, as baptiſme is, there is at leaſt preſuppoſed a true Church alſo. And therefore to condemne a Church to be falſe, and altogether Antichriſtian, and yet baptiſme there, and by the ſame adminiſtred, to be the ordinance of God; this I can ſee no rule for in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: and therefore I diſſent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> 6.</note> Chriſt hath diſclaimed and denieth all communion with the man of ſin, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelf and his ſubjects; and hath alſo proclaimed open warre againſt him in all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: and therefore he cals home his ſubjects, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.6.45. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4. Chriſt refuſeth to be laid as a chief corner ſtone under Antichriſts building, as he muſt be if he in his holy ordinance of baptiſme be granted to lie in his foundation: For baptiſme is no otherwiſe Chriſts ordinance but as it depends upon him the ordainer. But Chriſt denies Antichriſt any ſuch priviledge, and alſo forbids his people from taking a ſtone from Babylon to lay in the foundation of the I ords building; as <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.26. But if Antichriſts church be of himſelf, and ſo falſe; then all the parts thereof muſt be of his own deviſing, and falſe alſo. For if in oppoſition to a true Church of Chriſt, there is a falſe church of Antichriſts: which thing cannot be, if there be not in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to true ordinances of the one, falſe ordinances of the other, that are eſſentiall to the ſame, as the ordinance of baptiſme is. And ſo the like miniſtery proportionable to the ſame, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2. according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. with 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I cannot approve of that baptiſme in the church of Antichriſt to be Gods ordinance, becauſe in ſo doing I ſhall advance humane teſtimony above the Word of God. For I have no way to ſatisfie my conſcience whether I have that ordinance or no, but onely by Antichriſts Church-book, or my godfathers &amp; godmothers: which if the one be dead and the other loſt, then am I to ſeek my baptiſme. But at the beſt if any ſhould demand of me whether I were baptized or not: all that I can ſay is, that men tell me ſo; in all which Chriſt muſt have no voice, and the Word of God put to ſilence, as knowing no ſuch thing: and Antichriſts Church-book come in the place, as a ground of my faith in a truth ſo eſſentiall. Which thing I dare not approve of.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, to juſtifie baptiſme in the church of Antichriſt to be Gods ordinance, is to force men to ſin againſt conſcience; for if any man comes unto ſuch for fellowſhip in the truth, he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtifie the baptiſme he received of the man of ſin, as Gods ordinance, or elſe continue in that ſinfull way in which he is, and deſires to leave; I ſpeak now in their ſenſe whoſe practiſe it is, which I cannot at all aſſent unto for a truth.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, I cannot juſtifie Antichriſts baptiſme for Gods ordinance, becauſe it makes againſt Chriſts baptiſme in theſe two reſpects. Firſt, for the power by which the ſame was conſtituted, and ſo authoriſed in the hand of the Miniſter, being the power of the man of ſin, rejected of God as an enemic to the crown and dignitie of Chriſt the King of Saints. Secondly, in reſpect of that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40204:19"/>body into which the partie was baptized, and ſo by the ſame made a viſible member, and that was in the body of Antichriſt. In both which reſpects the baptiſme adminiſtered en the falſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ſtate, in my judgement cannot be the ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I dare not go from that rule and order which Chriſt left in his laſt Teſtament, for the conſtituting of his Church, and taking of members into the ſame, which is by faith and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. All which grounds being well conſidered, I cannot ſee by any rule of truth to approve of the baptiſme adminiſtred in a falſe Antichriſtian church to be Gods ordinance, inſtituted by Chriſt in his new Teſtament. That being there adminiſtred under a falſe power by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery upon a wrong ſubject in a falſe body, and yet the ſame Gods ordinance; this is more then I can find by the Word of God, from which rule I dare not go.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhewed my judgement, and ſome reaſons why I ſo judge of the baptiſme admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred in a falſe Antichriſtian eſtate, cannot be the ordinance of God, inſtituted by Chriſt in the Goſpel. And now I come to give anſwer to ſome of the chief grounds brought for the proving of the foreſaid baptiſme in the hand of Antichriſt to be the ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And firſt it is ſaid, that as Circumciſion adminiſtred in Iſraels great apoſtaſie remained ſtill the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God; ſo that when any of them did repent, and turned unto the Lord, they were received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being circumciſed again: and the like is now to be conſidered of baptiſme in the apoſtaſie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwer is, firſt it is like to be a bad cauſe that muſt be maintained from the corruptions of other perſons or ſtates: Is the order and government of Chriſts new ſtate and kingdom under the new Teſtament more weak and imperfect then that under the old, as we muſt go ſtill unto Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion for a rule how to make out our baptiſme? Is the light of the Moon become now more brighter then the light of the Sunne; and the heart vailed to ſee clearer then the face open, and the ſervant to teach the Son? Again, it is worth our conſideration, from what church Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt did apoſtinate, and go away from, as the ten Tribes did under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. But I paſſe this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer. that Circumciſion was not confined in the hand of the prieſthood then under the old Teſtament, as the adminiſtration of baptiſme is to the miniſtery of Chriſt now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Circumciſion was then by them adminiſtred according as God had commanded the ſame to be, both in reſpect of the matter and manner. 1. The ſame order. 2. A right ſubject. 3. The due time. 4. the true place. And laſtly, a lawfull Miniſter. But now the baptiſme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by Antichriſt is contrary in all the foreſaid reſpects, which is by a falſe power upon a wrong ſubject, by a falſe miniſter in a falſe body. The like cannot be ſhewed in circumciſion, nor yet in baptiſme, and God approving of the ſame to be his ordinance. And now to oppoſe this, <hi>Zipporah</hi> the wife of <hi>Moſes</hi> is brought for an example, to prove that the baptiſme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by a falſe Miniſter may be true baptiſme, as circumciſion was being adminiſtred by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.25.</p>
            <p>The anſwer is, firſt, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wife was in the action the hand of her husband for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of his life: for had not <hi>Zipporah</hi> circumciſed her ſon it ſeemes that God had ſlaine her husband; as <hi>ver.</hi> 24.25, 26. compared together.</p>
            <p>Secondly, herein God ſets forth his wiſdom and juſtice in the ſubjecting of his creature, to bring her ſo farre to ſubmit unto his will in that ordinance, as for to do the thing her ſelf; for whoſe ſake it is like the ſame was ſo long neglected, becauſe there was nothing ſo contrary and oppoſite unto her the Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſee not but that in a caſe of neceſſitie a woman might lawfully circumciſe ſhe being no where prohibited.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, what of all this, ſay ſhe did it unlawfully, and in ſo doing ſhe was a falſe Miniſter;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40204:20"/>all which is more then God ſaith, yet this was not done in a falſe Church, upon a wrong ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, authoriſed by a falſe power, as baptiſme adminiſtred by Antichriſt is, and therefore at the worſt it makes nothing at all for that which it is pretended, namely, to prove baptiſme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by Antichriſt the ordinance of God, though the ſame be alſo adminiſtred by a falſe Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again it is ſaid, that the Scriptures are the ordinance of God, which he hath ever preſerved, and ſtill owns for his ordinance in hand of Antichriſt: and ſo doth God of baptiſme there alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that God indeed doth preſerve the Scriptures, wherein is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> holy ordinances, as they are therein comprehended, and laid forth in their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rules, and that in the hands of wicked men, and ſo in the hands of Antichriſt himſelf. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in their conſtituted order and forms out of the hand of Chriſt his Church and miniſtery. And though that in many things Antichriſt hath corrupted the Scriptures, yet they remaine ſtill in themſelves the ordinance of God. But for the falſe expoſitions, gloſſes, and doctrines they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Scriptures, with the Church miniſtery, worſhip and government they build upon the Scriptures; and ſo their ordinances which they ſeem to conſtitute by them: now theſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee to be the ordinances of God any more the one then the other. So that if baptiſme with Antichriſt, as they ſay, be Gods ordinance, then why not upon the ſame ground the Supper, Church and Miniſtery, be Gods ordinances alſo, ſeeing they have the Scriptures as well for the one as for the other? And for baptiſme, as it is an inſtitution of Chriſt, and contained in the Scriptures, as a rule for the Lords people to walk by in their obedience to him; onely ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it is an ordinance of God, in whoſe hand ſoever the Scriptures are.</p>
            <p>But now for a falſe Antichriſtian Church, to conſtitute and adminiſter the like out of or apart from the Scriptures. Now ſo conſidered, it is not the ordinance of God, but mens invention, compoſed from the Scriptures, as a patern drawne forth in the likeneſſe or reſemblance of Gods ordinance, but not the ſame. For God hath communion with none in his word, but by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and faith; neither of which hath Antichriſt, and therefore though he hath the written Letter of the Scriptures, yet no communion with God in the ſame, ſo as to receive his ordinance of him: neither can any man conſtitute, and ſo adminiſter an ordinance of God without authoritie from Chriſt the Lord and King of his Church; which authoritie Antichriſt hath not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods ordinance of Baptiſme cannot be adminiſtred by Antichriſt in his falſe Anchriſtian Church and State, as ſome doe ſo affirme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is ſaid, that</hi> there is but onely one Baptiſme, <hi>and having once received that, though it be by Antichriſt, we need not to receive it any more; for we can have but the ſame againe, and that which we have is the ſame for ſubſtance with Chriſts inſtitution, which for the matter, there is Water, and for the forme there is the ſame words uſed as Chriſt inſtituted the ſame ordinance of Baptiſme in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwer is, firſt, that there is but one true baptiſme, that is a truth, and a man being once baptized by the ſame, he needs not to be baptized againe: this is alſo true, for I doe not approve of rebaptizing. But now to conclude from hence, that there cannot be a reſemblance of that one true baptiſme, and yet not the ſame, this will not follow: there is but one true Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt, as the Word of God reveals. But it will not follow therefore, that Antichriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſemble the ſame, and ſet up one of his own like unto that, or if that he doe, the ſame muſt be a true Church and Miniſtery, becauſe God approves but of one.</p>
            <p>But if Antichriſt (as you affirme) may reſemble the truth and ſet up a falſe Church and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which is the greater. Upon the ſame ground doe I affirme, that he may, nay, that he muſt alſo reſemble the true ordinances: by ſetting up falſe ordinances, which are the leſſer like unto the true, otherwiſe he could not put off his ware, for none would trade with him in his merchandiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Antichriſt hath not the ſubſtance of Gods holy ordinance in his baptiſme, though he uſe, or rather abuſe the words of Chriſts inſtitution in his adminiſtration, for then he ſhould alſo have the ſubſtance of all other ordinances of God, becauſe he uſeth the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40204:20"/>wherein they are inſtituted and contained. it is not the bare letter of Scriptare onely, but the true minde of Chriſt there ſet downe, that bears an ordinance, which none can know, but onely he who hath the Spirit of Chriſt, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. and this hath not Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I deny the water to be the matter, but onely the inſtrument in Baptiſme; for as fire is the inſtrument of burning, even ſo is water of waſhing; and as the matter of burning is the ſewell that is burnt, ſo the matter of waſhing is the partie waſhed; for as the matter of the Church is the Saints, and the matter of the Miniſtery, the Prophets, ſo the matter of baptiſme, are the perſons upon whom the ſame is conferred.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I deny the forme of words, with the uſe of water, in a falſe Antichriſtian Church, to be the forme of the Lords baptiſme, inſtituted by Chriſt in the new Teſtament; for then every fooliſh uſing of them words with water, muſt be the true ordinance of God, as many ignorantly doe affirme. But for the forme of Baptiſme, that is, authorized perſon, baptizing the true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the true and orderly profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>mat.</hi> 28.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. This being thus done by a true power and authoritie from Chriſt, is the forme of baptiſme in the adminiſtration thereof; but this doth not Antichriſt, and therefore his baptiſme is not Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next ground alledged to prove Baptiſme adminiſtred in a falſe Antichriſtian Church, to be the true ordinance of God, and ſo to be retained, is the veſſels of Gods houſe in Babylon, that as thoſe veſſels remained ſtill the Lords ordinance being in the hands of Gods enemies; and ſo may Baptiſme, as a veſſell of Gods houſe, being in the hand of Antichriſt, which is ſpirituall Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall anſwer to this in briefe: firſt, for the veſſels of the Lords houſe, they were Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that whiles they were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but not ſo as they onely conſiſted in their inſtituted formes, and not in reſpect of their conſtituted uſe: that is, as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> the King and his Princes made them their drinking cups, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.2, 3. Thus conſidered with reſpect to this uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> applyed them unto, they were not the ordinance of God, for God never ordained them for ſuch a uſe. Though in themſelves ſimply conſidered they were Gods ordinance, ordained by him to holy uſe. In which conſideration Baptiſme may be ſaid to be Gods ordinance in the Church of Antichriſt, or where ſoever the holy Scriptures of God are; onely as an inſtituted Rule in the word of God, for his owne people to obſerve, and obey him, by uſing it in that way, and to the ſame end, as God ordained and appointed the ſame ordinance unto.</p>
            <p>But now for Antichriſt to take the Scriptures, and according to his right of authoritie and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhall from the ſame compoſe a forme of worſhip, with ordinances ſutable thereunto. Among which Baptiſme muſt be one, without which all the reſt are nothing worth. Now though that Baptiſme as a holy inſtitution of Chriſt, contained in the Scriptures, be the ordinance of God, yet conſidered in Antichriſts conſtitution, and falſe adminiſtration, it is not the ordinance of God, no more then the Princes of <hi>Babylons</hi> drinking in the veſſels of the Lords houſe was his ordinance.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſecondly, God is ſaid in the Scriptures to give or to ſend the veſſels of his houſe to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.17, 18.21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.2, .22. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.2. Now let the like be ſhewed, where ever God is ſaid to give or to ſend his ordinance of baptiſme unto Antichriſt, untill then the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gods houſe remaining his ordinance in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſhall make nothing for them to prove Antichriſts ſprinkling of water in the face of an Infant, to be Gods ordinance of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here it is ſaid by ſome, that Antichrist as a thiefe hath ſtolne away Gods ordinance of Baptiſme out of his Church, for which he is ſaid not to have repented of his theft;</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.21.</p>
            <p>If this ſhould be true, herein they condemne themſelves, for whoſoever communicates with the thiefe in the thing ſtolne, he is as deepe in the ſinne as the thiefe himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it will be ſaid, that they having repented of the evill, God hath accepted of that, though they retaine their Baptiſme, as his ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can this be? which way doth their repentance appeare? ſo long as they retaine the thing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40204:21"/>that is ſtollen; for nature teaches thus much, that ſo long as any man keepes in poſſeſſion that which he knows was ſtollen, he is guiltle of the theft.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How doe ſuch know that God hath accepted of their repentance, while they Rill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the thing ſtollen, &amp; juſtifie the ſame; and how can they make it appeare by the word of God, that he approves of that Baptiſme for his ordinance, which they have received at the hand of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt? All which is worth the conſideration how theſe things can be made to appeare, that are ſo commonly taken for granted truths.</p>
            <p>Againe, thirdly, Though Antichriſt ſhould ſteale away the Lords baptiſme out of his Church, yet he could not ſteale away the power and authoritie of Chriſt, for to adminiſter the ſame upon any other; For though he ſhould bring away Chriſts baptiſme, yet it was but onely in his owne perſon; which thing he could not paſſe from himſelfe upon any other, as an ordinance of God, without the power and authoritie of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, let us conſider a little what may be here meant by theft, together with the helpe of other Scriptures, and that is mens bringing in their owne inventions, and humane traditions, and preſſing the ſame for truth upon the conſciences of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> by which means the truth of God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, and the way of the Lord obſcured, and ſo comes to looſe its eſteeme and authoritie in the heart of man, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6, 7. &amp; 4.17. In which ſenſe the falſe Prophets are ſaid to ſteale the word of God every one from his neighbour, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.30. that was by ſetting up their owne traditions, and preſſing the ſame for truth upon the people; by which means the commandements of God were made of no effect; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13. Of which the Lord complains that the feare by which the people feared him, was taught by the precepts of men, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. This way Satan in his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lies at all advantage, to diſable and prevent the Word for taking effect upon the hearts of men; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. And this is the theft, that the aforeſaid theeves and robbers had not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, and not Antichriſts ſtealing of the Lords Baptiſme out of his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it is thought by ſome, that the gold and rich attire, by which Antichriſt is painted, and the golden cup in the Gentlewomans hand, are the ordinances of God,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.4.</p>
            <p>As there is little matter in this to any purpoſe, I ſhall anſwer in briefe to the ſame. And firſt, that this is a comparative ſpeech, with reference to that outward pompe and glorious ſtate, wherein ſhee ſits triumphing as a Queene, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. And withall, the ſame wiſely and cunningly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by humane policy, under a generall forme of an outward profeſſion of Religion, yet oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth and power thereof, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.7. Under a ſhew of humilitie, and pretence of zeale, by her forwardneſſe in the executing of her power, againſt all ſuch that refuſe ſubjection to her holy orders, and to worſhip God according to that image and forme which ſhee hath ſet up, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.18.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15, 16. Thus by her policy ſhee draws forth her forme in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of truth, ſo far as it ſuits with reaſon and humane wiſdome; and therefore it is, that the greateſt Politicians and artificers are of her ſide, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.23. and ſo carries out things with a ſtrong hand, againſt all that ſhall oppoſe her, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.4. and through her great wiſdome, art, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhee is exalted, and becomes famous, and in great eſteeme for the generalitie of men; as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.18, 19. And therefore ſuch are beſt accepted of her, that are the ſtrongeſt for reaſon, and the moſt skilfulſt artificers, to paint, and to trim her up, and to ſet her forth in her glory and beautie to the eyes of men. And by this means ſhee as an harlot deceives the ſimple, and bewitches the Nations, as <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.16, 17. <hi>Nabum</hi> 3 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18</p>
            <p>All which is to be underſtood in a ſpirituall ſenſe, and in matters of Religion, and then her gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cup, and all her rich attire will appeare to be onely of the Gentlewomans own deviſed paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not any of the Lords ordinances, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.7. &amp; <hi>Jer</hi> 2.33. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.30. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.12, 13.16. So that here the holy Ghoſt ſets forth her ſtate to be <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpiritually conſidered, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8. and her Miniſters are ſet forth under the name of <hi>Merchants,</hi> becauſe they buy and ſell &amp; trade for her in all the Merchandiſe of her Religion, wherein all things are ſet at ſale, as much
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40204:21"/>as the ſoules and bodies of men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.13. that is, the penall laws impoſed to the forcing of their conſciences, &amp; ſuch as are rich to eſcape for money or friends, but ſuch as are poore or conſcious to abide the puniſhment, as a <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. the Merchants are ſtiled or called <hi>The great men of the earth, ver.</hi> 23. that is, great for humane learning, arts, and policy, to keep up her ſtate and trade, and make out the ſame againſt all gaine-ſayers, and what they want in skill, they have it in power, and ſo able to beare downe all before them, for they are the great men of the earth, and who is able to make war with the beaſt. The things they merchandiſe withall, are all manner of precious ſtones, and the like, which holds forth the curious art of nature, for the ordering and compoſing of all thoſe things concurring for the making up of that ſtate and forme, in ſo neere a reſemblance to truth. All which is without ſubſtance, for at length no man will buy their ware, which cauſeth great lamentation among the Merchants, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.11. And ſo I ſhall now leave this ſubject to the wiſe &amp; godly Readers conſideration, to mind well the truth of ſuch a practiſe, that leave a church as falſe and Antichriſtian, and yet approve of that Baptiſme there adminiſtred by a falſe and an Antichriſtian power, to be the true ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>I muſt here conclude with Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> in his <hi>Apologie againſt the Browniſts, pag.</hi> 17, 18.31. <hi>That either ſuch muſt goe forward to baptiſme, or elſe turne backe againe from whence they came;</hi> for there is no middle way, nor the leaſt light in the word of God to beare out the ſame, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſhall not doe whatſoever is right in your owne eyes, for you are not as yet come to your reſt, and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you,</hi> Deut. 12.8, 9. <hi>Ariſe and depart, for this is not your reſt, becauſe it is polluted,</hi> Micah 2.10. <hi>I am come a light into the world, that whoſoever beleeveth on me, ſhould not abide in darkneſſe,</hi> Joh. 12.46. <hi>And now why tarry yee, ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away your (Antichriſtian) ſinnes, calling on the name of the Lord,</hi> Act. 22.16. or ſubmitting to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and way of Chriſt. <hi>They reſiſted the counſell of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized of him, Luk.</hi> 7.30. Ariſe therefore and obey the Lord, and thinke not within your ſelves, we are baptized already, and that by Antichriſt, for I tell you that you are never able to prove your ſelves to be under the Lords holy ordinance of Baptiſme, by all the light in Scripture, and art in nature, in that way you goe, namely, to deny the ſtate as falſe and Antichriſtian, and yet retaine your bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme there adminiſtred by the ſame power, as the Lords ordinance, and aſſume a Church to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the ſame baptiſme. I ſpeake in ſubjection to better judgement, I thinke the laſt Church is as much againſt the Rules of the new Teſtament as the former. For certainly, where there is a falſe ſtate, conſtituted by a falſe power, all that ſtative ordinances eſſentiall to the ſame, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the ſame power, muſt be alſo of the ſame nature together with the reſt, which is all alike falſe; therefore if you take hence a corner ſtone to lay in your foundation, and build you a reſting place upon the ſame, know this, that it will not lie firme, but ever be rouling under you, that you ſhall not reſt long upon it, therefore ariſe and depart, for this is not your reſt, becauſe it is polluted, it will deſtroy you, even with a ſore deſtruction; look betimes, the higher you build, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall will be, if it be not right upon the true foundation. I doe beleeve that God will cauſe his truth to ſhine forth with power, both to cleare the darke clouds of ignorance off the hearts of men, and beare downe that which ſtands in oppoſition to the ſame; and if ſuch hath been ſo hard put to it, in the darke as it were, that they are forced to leave the holy and bleſſed word of God, and betake themſelves to Antichriſts power and teſtimony, to prove them under Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of baptiſme, though the whole body of the Scripture lies againſt them, what will ſuch doe when more light comes? they will then yeeld, or elſe appeare to be wilfull oppoſers of the truth. The Lord give them hearts to conſider, and to put their cauſe to the tryall of the holy and pure Word of God, and to bring all his people into one unitie of faith, and uniforme order of truth, that God may have glory, the Goſpel honour, the Saints comfort.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the former diſcourſe hath been about the right ſubject of Baptiſme, and that the word of God hath diſcovered to be a beleever; onely in the proving of which truth, there in alſo
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40204:22"/>diſproved two ſorts of perſons, and they are either beleevers Infants, or ſuch that received their Baptiſme of Antichriſt, and yet all in their infancy: both which are by the Scriptures diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the one being uncapable, and ſo without any Rule from God for the ſame; and the other alſo unlawfull, and ſo directly againſt the word of God, which diſclaimes all communion with the man of ſinne, in any of his divine ordinances, who receives nothing of the Lord, and therefore all that he can adminiſter unto any, is both of himſelfe, from himſelfe, and for himſelfe, and ſo not to be juſtified, nor retained as the Lords ordinance. And this falling out ſo, it followes that we are now to ſeeke for the Lords true Baptiſme, and for a caſe ſo difficult, as ſome would make it, two things in ſpeciall are to be inquired into; firſt, how, or where to finde it; ſecondly, how it may be obtained, being found: for the firſt, if any ordinance of God ſhould be ſo deceaſed in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as that we doe not know where it is afoot in Gods way in the world, ſo as to come by it with a good conſcience. A people in ſuch a caſe, being convicted of the truth, and he neceſſitie of their obedience to God in the ſame, and yet know not the way, or manner how to accompliſh their holy deſires, in the finding &amp; obtaining the ſame. They are to goe, as of old, to Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, as the godly then did; that is, to the holy Scriptures, which are the lively Oracles of God; the Spirit ſpeaking in them unto a beleeving heart; ſo they ſtand in the place of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, with the ſame abilitie &amp; authoritie, to furniſh a man of faith with all truth; as theſe Scriptures compared together ſufficiently prove, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15 16, 17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>Job.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.25.27.44, 45, 46. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4.</p>
            <p>By all which we ſee, that all things are contained in the Scriptures, unto which the holy Ghoſt leads men to prove and finde all things concerning faith and obedience to God and man, which are the Propheticall mouth of Chriſt, that all muſt have recourſe unto, that will have any thing to do with him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. And the Rule by which all muſt be tryed, though an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Apoſtles themſelves, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. So that the holy Scripture is the onely place where any ordinance of God in the caſe aforeſaid is to be found, they being the fountain-head, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the inſtituted Rules both of Church and ordinances, ſo that, where or whereſoever any of theſe are wanting in their conſtitution, and cannot be found in their outward orderly forme, wee are to go directly unto its inſtitution, and recover the ſame againe from thence, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7 8. And thus having found the place or ſubject, wherein baptiſme, ever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, as an ordinance of God, we are in the next place to know, how ſuch as want it may come or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly by it; for though that God hath joyned his word and ordinances together, yet he hath alſo ordained an orderly way for his people to come to enjoy them, which orderly way I conceive to be only in the Church of God, wherein is the power of Chriſt to ſet afoot his ordinances; as when God ſhall pleaſe to take a people to himſelfe, and by the power of his truth unite them to his Son, and ſo into an orderly body among themſelves, now ſuch a people, ſo conſtituted, have right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ſuch priviledges, ordained and appointed by God, for their mutuall comfort and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. By vertue of this union they have with their head Chriſt, the body thus joyntly conſidered, hath the power &amp; authoritie of Chriſt within her ſelfe, to chuſe and make uſe of any one, or more of her members as occaſion offers, and authoriſes his or them to adminiſter baptiſme upon the whole body, and ſo upon themſelves in the firſt place, as apart of the ſame. Such may be truly ſaid to be ſent, and authorized by Chriſt; as of old by Chriſt in his humane body, even ſo now by him in his divine and ſpirituall body; for whereſoever a Church doth riſe in her true conſtitution, there are her ordinances, and alſo power to adminiſter the ſame; and where a thing is wanting, there muſt be of neceſſitie a beginning to reduce that thing againe into beeing. And thus briefly I have ſhewed my judgement, in caſe baptiſme ſhould be wanting, where we ſhould finde it, and that is in the holy Scriptures of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How from thence to be obtained, and that is by Gods calling a people into an holy fellowſhip with Chriſt, from whom they have power to aſſume, as a Church, ſo the ordinance of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40204:22"/>Baptiſme upon themſelves. I ſhall yet further cleare up this truth, by ſhewing the manner of the foreſaid conſtitution in the cauſes of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But before I can doe this, I muſt give anſwer to two ſorts of perſons that oppoſe the aforeſaid truth; firſt, ſuch as ſtand for a perſonall ſucceſſion; ſecondly, ſuch as will have no Church before Baptiſme, and ſo make Baptiſme the forme of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the firſt, that hold Baptiſme by perſonall ſucceſſion, they have received a ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in proving of that Baptiſme adminiſtred by Antichriſt to be none of Gods ordinance; onely a word or two to ſuch as hold a ſucceſſion in the defection of Antichriſt, as they call it, if they meane by defection, the outward forme of worſhip, and government Eccleſiaſticall, a I thinke they doe, then all the power and authoritie that ever hath carried out any adminiſtration, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ordinance, hath taken its beeing thence, and depends upon the ſame; and if ſo, then the power and ordainer, and the ordinance ſo ordained, muſt be both of one and the ſame ſtamp, as I have already proved, if the one be Antichriſts, the other muſt be alſo Antichriſtian; and to dreame of any approved Church by the word of God, in, or under this defection, and yet a part of the ſame, is to look for a man in the Moone, and to ſuppoſe a Church to conſiſt in ſuch matter that is deſtructive to the forme, and therein to hold a ſucceſſion of truth, is againſt the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to keep the Pope upon the throne of Chriſt, whether he will or no; but to lay the chaine of ſucceſſion of truth this way, namely, through the Popedome of <hi>Rome,</hi> as all ſuch muſt doe that hold a perſonall ſucceſſion, or a Church, and ordinances to conſiſt in the ſame, from the Apoſtles untill now; what will ſuch doe, and where will their ſucceſſion of truth lie? when the ſame comes to the woman Pope, of whom the Papiſts themſelves are aſhamed; for when we ſpeake of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſucceſſion of truth, as in reference to Church, and Church ordinances, I looke upon this in the power and authoritie that beares the ſame: and to hold a Church to be true, and the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there adminiſtred the true ordinances of God, and to leave this, and ſet up a way of worſhip apart from it, and deny communion with it, is in my darke underſtanding, a meere ſchiſme, and the overthrow of all order in Religion; ſo far as I have learned Chriſt, men are to ſtand in their place, and uſe all means to reforme and reclaime or diſclaime by the word of truth; and all being done, and of neceſſitie I muſt by the word of God, leave off communion with them, I think by the ſame rule, I muſt diſclaime them, and ſo ſeparate away from them, if they doe not repent, and not to leave a true Church, and true ordinances, and goe apart and erect another Church, ordinances and worſhip of our ſelves apart from it, in oppoſition to it, this in my judgement is as farre from any Rule in the Goſpel of Chriſt, as for a man to baptize himſelfe, neither of which doe I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of. Yet a word, by the way, becauſe of ſuch an error that ſome make, and how far off from any rule or example, for a man to baptize himſelfe, or to baptize others, and himſelfe unbaptized, &amp; ſo thinking hereby to ſhut up the ordinance of God in ſuch a ſtrait, that none can come by it, but through the authoritie of the Popedome of <hi>Rome.</hi> But for the opening of this cloud that ſeems ſo to darken the skie, let the Reader conſider who baptized <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> before he baptized others, and if no man did, then whether he did not baptize others, he himſelfe being unbadtized, &amp; if he was baptized, whether it were not by an unbaptized perſon; and all Scripture being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, and this being one, we are taught by this what to doe upon the like occaſion. And for the continuation of the Church from Chriſts words, <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, &amp;c.</hi> I confeſſe the ſame with this diſtinction; which church is to be conſidered either with reſpect to her inſtituted ſtate, as it lies in the Scripture, in the Rules of the foundation, or in her conſtitution, or conſtituted forme in her viſible order. Againſt the firſt hell gates ſhall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, the foundation ſtands ſure; but againſt the laſt it hath often prevailed, for the Church in her outward viſible order, hath been often ſcattered through perſecution, and the like, in which ſenſe ſhe is ſaid to be prevailed againſt, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.1. Otherwiſe, where was their Church before it came from under the defection.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40204:23"/>
            <p>Againe, that which once was in ſuch a way of being, and ceaſeth for a time, and then comes to the ſame eſtate againe, is, and may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ruely be ſaid, to have ever a continuance, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0.38. In which ſenſe the Church may truely be ſaid ever to continue; for though ſhe be caſt downe at one time, yet God will raiſe her up at another, ſo that ſhee ſhall never be ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt, as to be utterly deſtroyed. And this way, I ſuppoſe, Chriſt may have &amp; injoy ever as good a wife as any can be preſerved for him under the defection of Antichriſt. Though ſome have ſo wide mouths open againſt ſuch as ever wiſhed them well; but I leave them to God, to whom they ſhall give account of all their hard words againſt the Lord, &amp; thoſe that fear his name, &amp; out of conſcience obey him in that way, as ſome pleaſe to call error, in a reproachfull manner. But men do in theſe dayes ſomewhat like to the tyrants in the ten perſecutions, whoſe crueltie was ſuch, that they expoſed the Chriſtians to be devoured of wild beaſts, and God ſo overpowred the creatures crueltie, that at length they ceaſed to hurt them: and when thoſe bloudy tyrants ſaw that, they put Beares-skins upon them, thereby to inſence and to ſtir up the nature of thoſe beaſts to fall upon them: thus I have heard reported. But whether this be true or not, ſure I am, that ſuch men can be little better minded, that labour ſo to cover the godly with ſuch filth, as they vomit out of their own-ſelfe-ſicke ſtomackes; but I deſire the Lord to paſſe by all, and to give men more love and patience to beare one with another.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, I feare men put more in baptiſme then is of right due unto it, that ſo preferre it above the Church, and all other ordinances beſides, for they can aſſume or erect a Church, take in and caſt out members, elect and ordain Officers, and adminiſter the Supper, and all anew, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any looking after ſucceſſion, any further then the Scriptures; but as for Baptiſme, they muſt have that ſucceſſively from the Apoſtles, though it comes through the hands of Pope <hi>Joane.</hi> What is the cauſe of this, that men can doe all from the Word, but onely baptiſme? and that muſt come by man, yea, and that by the man of ſinne. But we are to know this, that truth depends not upon Churches, nor any mortall creature, but onely upon the immortall God, who by his Word and Spirit reveales the ſame, when, and to whom he pleaſes. And for ſucceſſion of truth, it comes now by the promiſe of God, &amp; faith of his people, whom he as aforeſaid, hath taken out of the world unto himſelfe, in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel: to whom the ordinances of Chriſt ſtand onely by ſucceſſion of faith, and not of perſons; for the ſame power and authoritie the Apoſtles had in their time for direction in godlineſſe, the Scriptures have now in the hand of Chriſt, as the head of his Church, which make up but one body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15, 16. So that what the Church and the Apoſtles together might doe then, the ſame may the head and body, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Scriptures doe now, the Scriptures having the ſame authoritie in the Church now as the Apoſtles had then, the ſame Spirit being preſent now to reveale them, as then to write them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures remaining in the place of the Apoſtles for us to have recourſe unto, and ſerve as the mouth of Chriſt to all beleevers,<note place="margin">

               </note> as the Apoſtles did before they were written, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. And as the people of old conferred with the Prophets and Apoſtles about their great affaires, ſo have the Lords people now <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their writings, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29, 30, 31. Which are to us with the Spirit of life in them as effectuall, as their perſonall preſence, if not more, as <hi>Job.</hi> 6.62, 63. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.5.11. And thus all ſucceſſion from the beginning came to Chriſt, and from Chriſt to the Apoſtles, and from them to the Scriptures, which are the head-ſpring of all to us; ſo that, all ſucceſſion now is onely ſpirituall, according to faith, and follows not the perſonall ſucceſſion of any, but onely the word, that gives being to all order and ordinances that is of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo I come to ſuch as will have no Church before Baptiſme, and ſo make Baptiſme the forme of the Church. I ſhall be briefe in this, becauſe the truth of this will appear in the cauſes conſtituting the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I thinke we all agree in, that matter and forme conſtitutes a Church, the matter is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40204:23"/>of Saints, or perſons profeſſing faith in the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that is, in holines of life. The forme is that by which theſe are united and knit up together in one fellowſhip, and orderly body, and that is the covenant of grace that lies between God and his people, by which God viſibly becomes the God of ſuch perſons, and they his people above all other. That this is the forme of a Church, and not Baptiſme, I prove thus; that by which God and a people become each others apart from all other people, that is the forme of them; but the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is that by which God owns a people for his, and they him for their God, therefore the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the forme, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That which at the firſt was the forme of a thing, ever remaines the forme of the ſame thing without alteration, but the covenant was the forme of the Church at the firſt, before ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ordinance was annexed, therefore the ſame ſtill, the Church remaining the ſame without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the nature of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which both gives a beeing to a thing, and ever keeps the ſame, that muſt be the forme of the ſame thing, but the covenant both gave a being to the Church, &amp; ever keeps the ſame, therefore the covenant is the forme.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That which makes a member to be a member or no member of a Church, that makes a Church to be a Church, or no church, and ſo that is the forme of it, for there is the ſame reaſon for the whole, that is for every part, but the covenant is that which makes a member, and ſo the reſt, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 56.4.6. therefore the covenant is the forme.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> perſons may have, and yet be no church, that cannot be the forme of a church, but perſons may have baptiſme, &amp; yet no church, <hi>ergo,</hi> not the forme; the church being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ordinance of God, and the very center of all ordinances, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.7. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be formed by any particular ordinance, no nor by any leſſe then that which comprehends all the eſſentiall parts and properties of a church, which is Gods gracious covenant, that gives being to all true churches both firſt and laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſome will ſay, that the Word ſpeakes of no church before Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, I muſt diſtinguiſh in Baptiſme between the truth in the doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the outward adminiſtration of the ſame. In the firſt ſenſe Baptiſme is one branch of the covenant, as a truth to be revealed, and by faith to be received, as an eſſentiall truth, together with other truths, for the conſtituting of the church, and no church according to the order of Chriſts new Teſtament, either without it, or before it.</p>
            <p>But for the laſt, namely, the outward adminiſtration of Baptiſme, that ever follows the Saints joyning in fellowſhip, by mutuall faith &amp; agreement in the doctrine, wherein conſiſts the ſtating of the Church in her conjoyning in covenant, which ever goes before the adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and gives power and authoritie for the ſame. So that in the firſt ſenſe, the Church is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſme; but in the laſt ſenſe, the church is before Baptiſme. This diſtinction being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I anſwer in a word thus; we are not to deny a church to be a church untill the Word ſo calls it; for the church in the old teſtament, and moſt of the churches in the new Teſtament, were chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſometime before they were ſo called. And why may not the ſame be ſo here, be a church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſme be adminiſtred. Againe, a church is onely ſo a church before Baptiſme, as that the end of her union, is for communion, and ſo an immediate proceeding to the practiſe of the ſame truth ſhee agreed upon by a free and mutuall conſent in her conjunction. That which ſtates a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons in covenant, inſtates them in church-fellowſhip: but faith and not practiſe inſtates a people in covenant, for a people muſt firſt agree upon truth in judgement, before they practiſe the ſame, therefore faith and not practiſe, inſtates a people in church-fellowſhip; and ſo a church in covenant and fellowſhip before baptiſme be adminiſtred. A people are a church by covenant, unto which ordinances are annexed, to confirme and eſtabliſh the ſame, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Ezek</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. So that here was a church before ordinances, or that ever Baptiſme was adminiſtered either by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <hi>Some ſay from Act</hi> 2.41. <hi>They were added to the Church after they were baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, If it ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo, that they were after Baptiſme added to the Church, then they ſhould neither put on Chriſt by Baptiſme, not yet be baptized into one body, not to the true profeſſion of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. directly againſt theſe Scriptures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. And for <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. the words are theſe; <hi>Then they that gladly received his Word were baptized, and the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſoules;</hi> which is nothing elſe but to ſhew how many they were that received the truth, and ſo by the ſame were added to them, holding Forth the power and goodnes of God, in making his word ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in bringing in ſo many by one Sermon to the truth, as <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. which is onely a repeating over the number of Perſons God at that time added to the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe, it may be ſaid, that Baptiſme ſignifies our regeneration, and new birth. ſo that a childe muſt be firſt borne, and brought forth in Baptiſme, before it can be mad a living Member in Chriſts body the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Baptiſme indeed is a ſigne of the new birth, and ſo holds forth the ſame as a thing done, and not as a thing to be done, and therefore Baptiſme requites the appearance of the ſame, as faith and repentance to goe before the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof, which cannot be untill a man be borne from above, and ſuch as are ſpirituall alive, are the onely ſubjects of Baptiſme. This will be further cleared in the conſtitution of the Church, which now follows, which conſtitution is the orderly collection, &amp; conjoyning of perſons into the new covenant or viſible union with Chriſt their head, and ſo conſequently into an orderly body among themſelves; wherein the Saints are the matter, and the covenant the forme; from which two concurring, the Church ariſeth, and is by them conſtituted, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17 <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.16. to 19 <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.12, 13. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. with <hi>Gal</hi> 4.28. By which it appeares, that it is the promiſe, or the covenant of grace, that produceth a Chriſtian, and gives him a beeing in ſuch an eſtate of grace, as in Church-fellowſhip, and ſo conſequently the Church it ſelfe; for that which is true in a part, is the ſame in the whole.</p>
            <p>Now for the conſtituting cauſes by which God ordinarily uſeth to effect this worke; are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the word of God, which is to fit and prepare the matter for the forme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the confeſſion of faith, which is to declare the fitneſſe of the matter for the forme.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the free and mutuall conſent and agreement of the particular perſons, upon the practiſe of the ſame truth beleeved and confeſſed, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the Spirit of Chriſt, uniting and knitting up their hearts together, in and by the ſame truth; and of each of theſe a word.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the Word of God, ſitting and preparing of the matter; and this appeares in the miniſtery of <hi>John th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> who was to goe before Chriſt in the ſpirit and power of <hi>Elias,</hi> for to turne the hearts of the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the diſobedient unto the wiſdome of the juſt, and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17 Compare with this <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. where he is ſaid to prepare the way of the Lord, and to make his paths ſtraight. And now the manner how this is to be done, is to fill up every valley, and to bring down every mountain and hill, and to make the crooked ſtraight, and the rough wayes ſmooth: And ſo verſe 6. by the valleys is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch as whoſe hearts were poſſeſſed with fear, either of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them for ſin; or fear of the dangers, ſtraits, and difficulties, that attends the Goſpel of Chriſt, in the true profeſſion of the ſame. From both which the hearts of ſuch are to be freed, that are fit to follow Chriſt, and prepared ſubjects for his Kingdome, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. In which ſenſe the Goſpel is a preparative meanes to fill up ſuch valleys, by powring in the great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gods rich grace, and free love in Chriſt towards all ſuch as beleeve, and his all-ſufficiency to preſerve ſuch as ſuffer for his Names lake. And for laying low the mountains and hills, that is, to humble and to bring downe the proud heart of man, that exalts himſelfe, and cannot ſubmit unto the ſimplicitie of the Goſpel, and to that low and meane condition of Chriſt upon his Croſſe, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.11-22 with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. And for the crooked to be made ſtraight, that is, the crooked and Serpent like nature, wayes and evill diſpoſitions of men, theſe ſhall be changed, and made conformable to Chriſt And ſo for the making of the tough ſmooth, that is, the hard and rough turbulent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, that will admit of no rule, order, or peaceable ſocietie at all, ſhall by the word of God be made ſoft, ſmooth, and of ſuch a meek temper of ſpirit, as that all ſuch ſhall live together in love, innocent and harmleſſe, with unitie, peace, and uniformitie to Chriſt in all things, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9. All which Chriſt himſelfe often affirmed, that <hi>except a man deny himſelfe; he cannot be his diſciple.</hi> All which change thus upon the hearts of men, is by the power of the Word of God, by which they as matter are ſitted and prepared for the forme.</p>
            <p>The ſecond conſtituting cauſe, is the confeſſion of faith, which declares the fitnes of the matter for the forme; which confeſſion of faith is produced by the power of the Goſpel, ſhining into the heart of man, and drawes away the ſame after that which is by the Goſpel revealed. Which truth is of ſuch a working nature, that will not be kept in, but like unto leaven which ſo ſeaſons and ſweetens the whole man, that as fire at length it breaks forth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelfe, or rather ſuch as have it, &amp; not onely ſo, but it brings them together, by which they come now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre about the ſame, ſo that at length they come to be of one and the ſame minde and judgement in it, and withall convicted of their obedience thereunto. And upon this, here follows a third conſtituting cauſe, which is their free &amp; mutuall conſent and agreement upon the practiſe of that truth, ſo by God revealed, and by faith received as his will in their obedience thereunto: which agreement is between God and them in his truth, who by his power ſubjects
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40204:24"/>them to himſelfe by the ſame, and where this is in truth. Now comes the cauſe in the laſt place, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> and concludes the whole work, and that is the Spirit of grace and power, going forth in their hearts by faith uniting &amp; knitting them up together in one, for the manifeſtation of their obedience to God, in their practie all ſubjection to Chriſt in the ſaid truth, by them received and agreed upon as aforeſaid, and this is the Covenant that formes the Church, which ever goes in order before the externall adminiſtration of any other ordinance, then the matters joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together for orderly practiſe; for perſons muſt be informed of the truth in judgement, and bound by the ſame in conſcience, and agree upon the practiſe, before the ſame can orderly be put into execution; which foreſaid union is the holy Ghoſts conjoyning and uniting the ſaid perſons together in one and the ſame truth, and ſo conſequently into an orderly body among themſelves, immediately under Chriſt their head.

And ſo much in briefe of the conſtitution of a Church, or of the Saints entering into Church-fellowſhip, and the cauſes producing the ſame.</p>
            <p>And now being come into her own land, as of old was ſignified, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.24, 25. which is, into a viſible covenant with God, or union with Chriſt, and ſo become his own, ſhee is now to be waſhed with water in Baptiſme, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 5. And thus being in covenant with God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, in which their ſtate conſiſts and ſo the agreement made, &amp; the covenant paſſed between them, now the ſeale is ſee to, which is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinance of Baptiſme, to confirme the ſame; which being done, ſhe is then to enter upon her holy communion in all the reſt of Gods holy ordinances thereunto belonging, for her comfort and well-being.</p>
            <p>And thus I have by Gods gracious aſſiſtance done with this ſubject charged upon me, partly by ſuch as feare the Lord in a far Countrey beyond the Seas; and partly by my own conſcience for the truths ſake at home. And good Reader, confider well before you judge, and what I ſee not, teach thou me, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 34.31. But let not my unweary Read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> be offended with me, though I ſpeake a word or two more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It may be ſome will aske me, if I condemne all Churches, but onely ſuch as I have here deſcribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that I condemne no Church, which God approves of in his word: ſecondly, I condemne no Church at all; for I goe not about to ſhew who are falſe, but what is true, and it is enough for me if ſuch a Church as hath been ſpoken of be granted to be true, and let all others alone, to ſtand and fall to their own Maſter; and in regard of thoſe reproachfull clamours, caſt upon all without exception, that ſeem to be of my judgement about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, I ſhall yet make bold with my Reader, briefly to declare a word of my faith, what I beleeve and hold to be truth, and deſire to practiſe the ſame, and ſo leave all to God, &amp; for the godly Reader to judge, what difference there is between him and me, in the maine, that men ſhould be ſo incenſed againſt me, as to ſeeke my life, as ſome have done, the Lord in mercy forgive them, and lay it not to their charge. And now for my faith.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I doe beleeve, that there is onely one God, who is diſtinguiſhed in three perſons, God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the holy Ghoſt; yet but one in nature, or eſſence, without diviſion, and uncommunicable, who made the world, and all things therein, by the word of his power, and governes them all by his wiſe providence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I beleeve that God made man in his own Image, an upright and a perfect creature, conſiſting of ſoule and body: which body God framed of the earth, and breathed a ſoul into the ſame. To whom God gave a law, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his keeping of which depended all his happineſſe; and upon the contrary attended his miſery, which ſoon took effect; for he breaking that Law, he fell under the curſe, and the wrath of God lay upon him &amp; all his poſterity. By which fall, Man loſt the knowledge of God, &amp; utterly diſabled himſelf of all ability ever to recover the ſame againe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I beleeve God out of the counſell of his own will, did before he made the world, elect and chooſe ſome certain number of his foreſeen fallen creatures, and appointed them to eternall life in his Sonne, for the glory of his grace: which number ſo elected, ſhall unavoydably be ſaved, and come to glory, and the reſt left to themſelves, in their ſinne, to glorifie his juſtice.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I beleeve that God in the fulneſſe of his owne time, did ſend his Sonne, the ſecond perſon, who in the wombe of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> aſſumed mans nature, and in the ſame he ſuffered death upon the Croſſe, onely as he was man, to ſatisfie his Fathers juſtice, for the ſinnes of all his elect, and them onely; and that he lay three dayes &amp; three nights in his grave, from whence he aroſe the third day by the power of his Godhead, for the juſtification of all for whoſe ſinnes be dyed; and that in the ſame body Chriſt dyed, be aroſe from tho dead, and afterwards aſcended into heaven, the place of glory, where he was before, and there to remaine untill he comes at the laſt day to judge the world in righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I beleeve that God of his grace, in his own time, effectually calls ſuch as ſhall be ſaved to the knowledge
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40204:25"/>ſive, as a childe in the parents begetting of it; and ſo God by his Spirit works faith in the hearts of all ſuch to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, and his righteouſnes, only for juſtification. And thus they are made righteous before God in Chriſt, and ſo conformable to the will of the Father through the Sonne; and alſo made holy through the worke of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the holy Spirit of grace dwelling in them; yet all ſuch have ſtill as long as they live here in the fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them, an old man, that originall corruption, the fleſh that warres againſt the Spirit, which hinders them in their obedience both to God and man, and many times draws them to that which is evill, and contrary to their intentions; yet all of them ſhall through Chriſt overcome, and ſafely be brought to glory at laſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I beleeve the holy Scriptures to be the word of God, and have the onely authoritie to binde the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the obedience of all therein contained, and are the allſufficient Rule by the Spirit of God, to guide a man in all his obedience both to God and man.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, As for the abſence of originall ſin, and power in the will to receive and refuſe grace and ſalvation being generally offered by the Goſpel, and Chriſts dying for all perſons univerſally, to take away ſinne, that ſtood between them and ſalvation, and ſo laid downe his life a ranſome for all without exception, and for ſuch as have been once in Gods love, ſo as approved of by him in Chriſt for ſalvation, and in the covenant of grace, and for ſuch to fall ſo as to be damned eternally, and all of the like nature, I doe beleeve is a doctrine from beneath, and not from above, and the teachers of it from Satan, and not from God, and to be rejected as ſuch that oppoſe Chriſt and his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Eightly, I doe beleeve the reſurrection of the dead, that all ſhall riſe and come to judgement, and every one give account of himſelfe to God, and receive according to the things done in their bodyes, whether they be good or bad; therefore no conſcience ought to be forced in the matters of Religion, becauſe no man can beare out another in his account to God, if in caſe he ſhould cauſe him to ſinne.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, I do beleeve the King is ſet upon his throne by God, who hath given him power and authority to reigne and rule for God over all his ſubjects, as ſupreame head over all perſons in his Dominions; in whom is reſident all power to puniſh any that ſhall offend either againſt his royall perſon, crowne, or dignity, and that all his Subjects are to obey him out of conſcience to God, and all in lawfull authoritie under him; and wherein they rule w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l, I am bound in conſcience actually to obey and aſſiſt them to the utmoſt of my abiliaie, both in my perſon and ſtate; and wherein they goe amiſſe, that I cannot with a good conſcience, actually obey them, as aforeſaid, I ſhall paſſively ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my body to ſuffer their pleaſure (according to the Word of God) in what they ſhall inflict upon me without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: this is my faith, and the faith of all that I deſire to have fellowſhip with.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I do beleeve that there is an holy and bleſſed communion of Saints, that God of his grace calls ſuck as belong to life by election, unto the fellowſhip of his Sonne by the Goſpel; of which matter, God by his Word and Spirit joyns them together in his covenant of grace, and ſo conſtitutes his Church, as I have before ſhewed: And as God hath thus built for himſelfe an holy habitation of ſuch pure matter, and alſo after ho holy a manner, even ſo hath he provided a way of preſervation and ſafetie for the ſame; as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.1. <hi>We have a ſtrong Citie, ſalvation will God appoint for walls and bulworks:</hi> which Citie is ſaid to <hi>have a wall both great and high,</hi> and built upon twelve foundations; great that none ſhall break through, &amp; high, that none ſhall overtop or get over, and ſtrong in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that nothing ſhall ſhake it;<note place="margin">
